This is crucial because each word can only participate in one pair.\n     - If it is not found, we add the current word to the set to potentially pair with another word later.\n\n3. **Return Count**: After processing all words, `pairs_count` will hold the maximum number of valid pairs, which we return.\n\nThis method ensures each word is only paired once, maximizing the number of pairs that can be formed from the given list."}

Since we have up to 10 numbers (as deduced from constraints typical in competitive programming problems), bit manipulation is efficient and feasible.\n\n- **Memoization with `lru_cache`**: Use `lru_cache` to avoid recomputation. The state is represented by the last chosen index (`last_idx`) and the current bitmask (`mask`) of used numbers.\n\n- **Recursion Logic**: \n  - If the bitmask is full (all numbers are used), we have found a valid permutation, so return 1.\n  - Otherwise, iterate over all numbers, and attempt to use each number that hasn't been used yet.\n  - Check if adding the current candidate number maintains the special condition with the last number in the sequence (or if there's no last number, just proceed with any).\n  - Accumulate results, ensuring to take mod `10^9 + 7` to keep numbers within limits.\n\n- **Initial Call**: Start with an uninitialized (`-1`) `last_idx`, indicating no initial number has been chosen and an empty mask (`0`), meaning no number has been used yet.\n\nBy this method, we efficiently compute the number of special permutations while keeping computational feasible for possibly larger lists within given constraints."}

Specifically, for any subarray starting from index `i` to `j`, any two elements `nums[i1]` and `nums[i2]` within this range should satisfy the condition `0 <= |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2`.\n\nTo efficiently compute the number of such subarrays, we can make use of a two-pointer technique (also known as the sliding window approach). This technique will help us maintain a window of valid indices and efficiently expand and shrink this window to count all valid subarrays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Use two pointers, `left` and `right`. `left` will track the start of the subarray, and `right` will explore potential end points of the subarray. Start both at the beginning of the array.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Expand `right` to include more elements and check the validity of the subarray by keeping track of the minimum and maximum elements in the current window (from `left` to `right`).\n\n3. **Validity Check**: As you include a new element by moving `right`, check if the condition `0 <= |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2` for all elements in the current window is violated. This can be done by checking if the difference between the current maximum and minimum elements in the window exceeds 2.\n\n4. **Adjust `left` Pointer**: If the condition is violated, increment the `left` pointer until the subarray becomes valid again. Recompute the minimum and maximum as you increment `left`.\n\n5. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Each valid position of `right` defines several subarrays that end at `right` and start anywhere from `left` to `right`. These contribute to the count of continuous subarrays.\n\nHere's the implemented Python code using this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def continuousSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        left = 0\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Min and Max in the current window\n        min_num = float('inf')\n        max_num = float('-inf')\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            # Update the min and max for the current window\n            min_num = min(min_num, nums[right])\n            max_num = max(max_num, nums[right])\n            \n            # If the current window breaks the condition, adjust the left pointer\n            while max_num - min_num > 2:\n                left += 1\n                # Since we are moving left forward, update min and max\n                if left <= right:\n                    min_num = min(nums[left:right+1])\n                    max_num = max(nums[left:right+1])\n            \n            # Count subarrays ending at `right`\n            # Each position `k` from `left` to `right` is a valid start, so add `right - left + 1` subarrays.\n            count += (right - left + 1)\n        \n        return count\n```\n\nThis code efficiently keeps track of the subarrays that satisfy the condition using a linear traversal of the array with dynamic window resizing. By incrementally calculating valid subarrays ending at each `right` index, it ensures all continuous subarrays are considered."}

The provided operation allows us to select any subarray of size `k` and decrease each of its elements by 1. A key observation here is that reducing by 1 must occur simultaneously for all elements in the selected subarray.\n\nTo make all numbers zero, the main idea is to track how the \"net effect\" of performing operations progresses through the array.

Traversing the array while maintaining a `current_decrease` that represents how the elements have been decreased due to previous operations that are still affecting the current index.\n2.

We can achieve this by applying the allowable operation to each element of the array to create a subsequence of equal numbers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the idea:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformations**: For each element `nums[i]`, we can replace it with any number in the range `[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]`. This means that any element can essentially be transformed into a number within its specific range.\n\n2. **Overlap of Ranges**: To create the longest subsequence of equal elements, we want to find the maximum overlap of these ranges. If we can collect a lot of indices whose ranges overlap at a particular point (i.e., they can all be transformed into one specific number), we can have a long subsequence of that particular number.\n\n3. **Sorting**: By sorting the array, we facilitate determining which elements can be transformed into the same number. \n\n4. **Sliding Window or Two-Pointer Approach**: After sorting, we use a sliding window or two-pointer technique to find the maximum subset of indices whose ranges overlap at any point. This is done by examining consecutive elements and determining if their transformation ranges overlap.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the nums array\n        max_beauty = 0\n        left = 0\n        \n        # Step 2: Use the sliding window technique\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            # While the current range does not overlap within [nums[left] - k, nums[right] + k]\n            while nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k:\n                left += 1  # Slide the window to the right\n            \n            # Calculate the size of the window which gives us the number of overlapped ranges\n            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_beauty\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: The algorithm begins by sorting the array. This is crucial for efficiently finding where ranges overlap.\n  \n- **Sliding Window Technique**: We use two pointers: `left` and `right`.\n  - `right` expands the window by moving to the right (expanding the window to check new elements).\n  - `left` contracts the window from the left while the condition `nums[right] - nums[left] > 2 * k` is true. This condition ensures that every number within the current window can be converted to the same value.\n  - The length of the window `right - left + 1` gives the number of elements that can be turned into the same number, representing the subsequence length.\n\n- **Optimization**: By using two pointers, we efficiently find the maximum length of a subsequence where all elements can become a single number, maximizing the \"beauty\" of the array. \n\nThis approach works efficiently in O(n log n) time complexity due to the sorting step, followed by a linear pass, which is optimal given the constraints."}

If no pairs meet the criteria, return `-1`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging dictionary operations to maintain tracking of pairs, and it does this in a single scan over the numbers."}

A string can be rearranged into a palindrome if at most one character appears an odd number of times. This fact allows us to use a technique based on bit manipulation to represent the character counts along paths in the tree.\n\nThe approach involves these main steps:\n1. Understand that the path from node u to v can be composed by intersecting paths from root to u and root to v.\n2. Use bitmasks to keep track of character frequencies on paths. Each bit in an integer can be used to denote whether the count of a corresponding character is odd (1) or even (0).\n3. Use XOR properties to calculate the frequency changes. Specifically, the XOR of two paths from the root will give you the path character frequencies from one node to the other.\n4.

The goal is to make all elements equal in the minimum number of operations.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - The operation `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]` and `nums[(i + 1) % n]` suggests a circular nature to the array.\n   - We need to spread any selected element across the entire array. \n   - Instead of spread from one point, why not spread the similar values found, as starting points (they are already in the array).\n\n3. **Spread from Matching Values**:\n   - We can start the spread from multiple locations where the value we want to make the entire array is already available.\n   - By calculating the maximum distance between occurrences of the same value, we can determine how to fill any gaps efficiently.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Preprocess to find all occurrences of each number.\n   - For each number, calculate the maximum gap between consecutive occurrences.\n   - The maximum of these maximum gaps across all numbers gives the time needed.\n   - Adjust for this maximum gap to determine the minimum time required.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSeconds(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        position_map = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        # Record positions of each value.\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            position_map[num].append(i)\n        \n        # Determine maximum distance for each number's occurrences\n        min_seconds = float('inf')\n        \n        for positions in position_map.values():\n            # The distance in original array and the circular connecting distance\n            max_gap = 0\n            num_occurrences = len(positions)\n            \n            for j in range(num_occurrences):\n                # Find distance between consecutive occurrences, circularly\n                current_gap = (positions[(j + 1) % num_occurrences] - positions[j] - 1) % n\n                max_gap = max(max_gap, current_gap)\n            \n            # Calculate seconds needed with respect to the gaps\n            min_seconds = min(min_seconds, max_gap)\n        \n        # It takes ceil(gap / 2) seconds to spread the value over the gap\n        return (min_seconds + 1) // 2\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Position Map**: We first create a dictionary capturing all indices for each distinct value in the array.\n- **Compute Gaps**: We then compute the largest gap between successive positions for each number, considering the wraparound using modulo arithmetic.\n- **Minimal Time Calculation**: The `max_gap` for each number tells us how far we might have to spread to make everything that number, hence `(max_gap + 1) // 2` is the number of seconds needed to fill this gap, as we can move 1 step per second from both ends of the gap. \n- Finally, we return the minimum of these computed times.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the needed time by focusing on the largest gaps between similar values, ensuring optimal computation of spread time."}

This involves checking if the start of the offer is earlier than house 0. If so, it will simply carry the current profit `gold`, otherwise, it will add the maximum profit up to `start-1`.\n\n5. **Choosing Profit Maximization**: At each house, update the `dp[i]` with the maximum value by considering both accepting new offers ending at `i` and carrying over previous profits.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Finally, the maximum profit collected is available at `dp[n-1]`, which accounts for processing up to the last house or the last processed valid offer.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum amount of gold you can earn by ensuring all possible competitive offers are considered without any overlaps."}

If adding doesn't violate, we append it to `nums`.\n\n- **Avoid Target Pairing**: The condition can be relaxed (and simplified due to the sorted nature of the candidate numbers being added).

This implies that indices which share prime factors in certain ways have constraints on selection.\n\nOne easy observation is that:\n- If you have indices \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) is self-consistent, you may form perfect squares more easily.\n- Normally, square of any integer is always a perfect square, i.e., \\( i \\times i \\) is a perfect square.\n\nConsidering these observations, one approach is to utilize a dynamic programming technique or group numbers based on their index properties, but here we'll solve it in a relatively simpler manner considering constraints aren't heavy.\n\nThe code below calculates potential sums based on index groups:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport math\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n\n        # Function to get all perfect squares up to a given number\n        def get_perfect_squares(limit):\n            squares = set()\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= limit:\n                squares.add(k * k)\n                k += 1\n            return squares\n        \n        perfect_squares = get_perfect_squares(n * n)\n\n        # Setting up a DP array\n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Checking for each i if it's part of a perfect square group\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            dp[i] = nums[i - 1]  # Include itself\n            for j in range(1, i):\n                if i * j in perfect_squares:\n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + nums[i - 1])\n        \n        return max(dp)\n\n# The execution:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.maximumSum([1, 3, 7, 10]))  # Example usage\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Perfect Squares Calculation**: We get all perfect squares up to \\( n^2 \\) since any index pair \\( (i, j) \\) can result in products up to this value.\n2. **DP Array**: `dp[i]` holds the maximum sum of a subset that includes the index \\( i \\).\n3. **Subset Selection**: For each index \\( i \\), consider every possible `j` (where \\( j < i \\)) and check if \\( i \\times j \\) is a perfect square. If yes, update the potential maximum sum ending at index \\( i \\).\n\nThis solution covers basic constraints and assumes indices from 1 to \\( n \\). It calculates the perfect squares ahead of time and reuses them efficiently to ensure every possible subset sums are considered while obeying the core constraint of the problem."}

The overall aim is to minimize the number of such moves.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of how we can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Calculate Excess and Deficit:**\n   - Iterate through the grid to identify excess stones (cells with more than one stone) and deficit cells (cells without stones).\n   - For each cell, if the number of stones is greater than one, record the number of excess stones.\n   - If a cell is empty, it will have a deficit of one stone.\n\n2. **Redistribute Stones:**\n   - Use a greedy method to move stones from excess cells to deficit cells, keeping track of the distance moved for each stone.\n   - The distance is the absolute difference in row indices plus the absolute difference in column indices, which accounts for stones moving to adjacent cells being cheaper.\n\nHere's the implemented code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumMoves(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # To hold positions with surplus and deficit stones\n        excess_stones = []  # (row, col, excess_count)\n        deficit_stones = []  # (row, col)\n        \n        # Find excess and deficit stones in the grid\n        for r in range(3):\n            for c in range(3):\n                num_stones = grid[r][c]\n                if num_stones > 1:\n                    excess_stones.append((r, c, num_stones - 1))\n                elif num_stones == 0:\n                    deficit_stones.append((r, c))\n        \n        # We will calculate the minimum moves required\n        moves = 0\n        \n        # Pair surplus stones by transferring to deficit positions\n        for er, ec, excess in excess_stones:\n            # Distribute excess stones to deficit cells\n            while excess > 0 and deficit_stones:\n                dr, dc = deficit_stones.pop(0)  # Take a deficit position\n                required_moves = abs(er - dr) + abs(ec - dc)  # Calculate distance/moves\n                moves += required_moves\n                excess -= 1\n        \n        return moves\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n\n- **Initialization:** Initialize two lists, `excess_stones` and `deficit_stones`, to record positions with excess and deficient stones, respectively.\n- **Identify Surplus and Deficit:** Iterate over each cell in the grid to determine if it has excess stones or is a deficit. Populate the corresponding list with the details of such cells.\n- **Redistribution Strategy:** Iterate over the `excess_stones` and for each tuple, try to move stones to positions identified in `deficit_stones`. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the surplus and deficit positions, which translates to the minimum moves required.\n- **Return Result:** Once all redistributions are done, return the total number of moves calculated.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by targeting deficit cells with excess stones using minimal moves."}

This is done using bitwise operations to isolate and count bits.\n\n2. **Constructing Maximum Values**: To maximize the sum of squares, we construct numbers by prioritizing the use of higher bit positions first. This maximizes the value of the constructed number `x`, hence maximizing `x*x`.\n\n3. **Iterative Construction**: We repeat the construction process exactly `k` times to select `k` numbers that yield the largest sum of their squares, each time decrementing the count of used bits and considering their value impact.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the final result can be significantly large, we compute the output modulo `10**9 + 7` in each step to ensure it fits within standard data limits."}

To achieve this, we should increment elements in the original array `nums` such that this condition holds. \n\nWe need to ensure that for every starting position of a subarray of size at least 3, the elements within that subarray reach a maximum value of at least `k`. The simplest approach is to consider the sliding window approach, iterating over all possible subarrays with size 3 or more and checking if their max value is already `>= k`. If not, increment operations are required.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minIncrementOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        increment_count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible subarray starting point of size >= 3\n        for start in range(n - 2):\n            # Find the largest element in the current subarray of size 3\n            max_val = max(nums[start:start+3])\n            # If the max is already >= k, no need to increment\n            if max_val < k:\n                # We need to make sure the max element in this window is at least k\n                # We increment the current max element to reach value k\n                increment_count += k - max_val\n                # Update the max element to be >= k\n                nums[start + nums[start:start+3].index(max_val)] += k - max_val\n\n        return increment_count\n```\n\nThis function iterates over every possible subarray of size 3, calculates its maximum, and ensures it's at least `k` by incrementing the necessary number in the subarray. This solution ensures each subarray of size 3 starting from index `start` has a max greater than or equal to `k` with minimal increments.\n\nThis solution might be optimized further by advanced techniques but serves as a simple and direct approach to understand and solve the problem at hand. Keep in mind that each increment has been accumulated in the `increment_count` variable to be returned as the final answer."}

Here’s a strategy to solve the problem efficiently:\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Understanding XOR Behavior**: XOR flips the bits, so understanding the optimal way to align the bits of `x` with either `a` or `b` will help maximize the product.\n\n2. **Binary Analysis**: For each bit position, decide whether setting the bit in `x` will maximize the result. The maximum possible value at each bit can be reached by making `(a XOR x) * (b XOR x)` as large as possible by strategically selecting `x`.\n\n3. **Brute Force Limitation**: Directly iterating over all possible values for `x` (\\(0 \\leq x < 2^n\\)) is computationally expensive for larger `n`. Instead, compute outcomes based on bit positions.\n\n4. **Calculate XOR Maximization Per Bit**: \n   - For each bit from `n-1` down to `0` (most significant bit to least significant bit), choose `x` such that the bits of `(a XOR x)` and `(b XOR x)` are opposite, which should (except for some edge cases) help in maximizing the product.\n\nHere is a Python solution implementing this strategy:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumXorProduct(self, a: int, b: int, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        max_val = 0\n        \n        for x in range(2**n):\n            ax = a ^ x\n            bx = b ^ x\n            max_val = max(max_val, (ax * bx) % MOD)\n        \n        return max_val\n\n# Usage\nsol = Solution()\nprint(sol.maximumXorProduct(3, 10, 3))  # Replace 3, 10, 3 with your specific input values\n```\n\n**Explanation of Implementation:**\n\n- The solution iterates over all possible values for \\(x\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(2^n - 1\\).\n- For each \\(x\\), it calculates `(a XOR x)` and `(b XOR x)`, computes their product, and updates the maximum found so far.\n- The result is returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to stay within the problem constraints.\n\nThe crucial bit of this approach is it simplifies to trying all possible values for `x`, allowing us to compare each potential result directly without additional bit manipulation optimization. In practice, optimizations involving strategic bit setting can reduce the range of consideration, but often these direct calculations suffice given the constraint conditions."}

It uses a frequency dictionary to ensure each character appears exactly `k` times and iterates through the substring to ensure each pair of adjacent characters are at most 2 positions apart in the alphabet.\n  \n- **Nested Loop for Substrings:** We iterate over all possible substrings of `word` using two nested loops where `start` gives the beginning index of the substring and `end` gives the end index (exclusive). `word[start:end]` generates all possible substrings.\n\n- **Complete Substring Counting:** For each substring generated, we use `isComplete()` to check if it is complete. If true, we increment our count.\n\nThis approach considers every possible substring and checks both completeness criteria for each. Depending on the length of the word and the value of `k`, this might not be the most efficient for very large inputs, but it aligns with the direct implementation of the problem requirements."}

Instead, you must deal with pairs of `mi`. The formula `(nums.count(mi) + 1) // 2` calculates how we can combine these `mi` pairings to reduce the array to its minimum size.\n\nThis algorithm ensures efficiency by leveraging properties of numbers and the modulo operation to minimize the array size."}

Iterate over all possible starting and ending indices to extract every subarray.\n2. For each subarray, remove it from the original array.\n3.

Each operation allows us to replace two consecutive numbers with their bitwise AND. The goal is to strategically perform these operations to lower the overall OR result.\n\nThe strategy revolves around understanding how AND and OR operations interact. The AND operation will always result in a value that is less than or equal to the smallest operand, while the OR will accumulate bits from both operands. Thus, reducing certain numbers by ANDing them with others can reduce the overall OR.\n\nHere's how you can approach implementing the solution:\n\n1. We will evaluate what the result of converting pairs to a single value using AND would be.\n2. Track the impact of these operations on reducing the OR result of the entire array.\n3.

Here's a breakdown of the code and logic:\n\n1. **Hashing Class**: \n   - This class calculates a hash for each prefix of the string to allow efficient substring comparison.\n   - We use a polynomial hashing technique, where `base` is a predefined prime number to reduce collision chances, and `mod` is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.\n   - The hash and power arrays are precomputed for quick access.\n\n2. **Substring Hash Query**:\n   - The `query` method returns the hash value of any substring of `word` using precomputed values, allowing O(1) access time.\n\n3. **Iterating to Find the Minimum Time**:\n   - The main function `minimumTimeToInitialState` iterates over the string with steps of `k`.\n   - At each step, it compares the hash of the current suffix with the prefix of the remaining string.\n   - If the hashes match, it means the segments are equivalent, indicating the string might be cyclic. Thus, the quotient of `i // k` gives the number of operations to return to the original state.\n\n4. **Edge Case**:\n   - If no matching rotation is found before a full cycle around the string's length, the function returns a calculation of `(n + k - 1) // k`, which ensures at least one full rotation around the string size. This computes the smallest number of operations needed to potentially revert the string at least once fully.\n\nThis method is efficient due to its use of hashing which allows quick comparisons rather than direct string comparison, reducing the time complexity significantly."}

This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time by utilizing precalculated sums.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compute**: For each possible number of subarrays (from 1 to `k`), and for each possible end of the subarray in `nums`, we'll consider all possible choices for where the previous subarray might end, compute the strength for that configuration, and update our `dp` table accordingly.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the above plan:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumStrength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # Compute the prefix sums\n        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i]\n\n        # Initialize dp array\n        dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]\n        dp[0][0] = 0  # No subarrays used, strength is 0\n\n        # Fill the dp table\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            for j in range(i, n + 1):  # We need at least `i` elements to make `i` subarrays\n                for p in range(i - 1, j):  # Consider previous ending of subarray\n                    strength_modifier = (k - (i - 1)) if i % 2 == 1 else -(k - (i - 1))\n                    current_subarray_sum = prefix[j] - prefix[p]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][p] + strength_modifier * current_subarray_sum)\n\n        # Answer is the best strength we can get using exactly `k` subarrays\n        result = float('-inf')\n        for j in range(k, n + 1):\n            result = max(result, dp[k][j])\n\n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Prefix Array**: `prefix[j]` stores the sum of the first `j` elements of `nums`. It helps calculate the sum of any subarray `nums[p:j]` as `prefix[j] - prefix[p]`.\n- **DP State**: `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the maximum possible strength using exactly `i` subarrays from the first `j` elements.\n- **Transitions**: For adding the `i-th` subarray ending at `j`, we consider all possible positions `p` to end the `(i-1)-th` subarray. We use the given formula to adjust strength using the weight `(k - (i - 1))`.\n- **Result Extraction**: The largest value in `dp[k]` gives the maximum strength attainable using exactly `k` subarrays.\n\nThis solution leverages the constraints and efficiently fills out the DP table to obtain the maximum \"strength\"."}

If it is, increment the count.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubmatrices(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:\n        if not grid or not grid[0]:\n            return 0\n        \n        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Create a prefix sum matrix\n        prefix_sum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        \n        # Fill the prefix sum matrix\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                prefix_sum[i + 1][j + 1] = (grid[i][j] + \n                                            prefix_sum[i][j + 1] + \n                                            prefix_sum[i + 1][j] - \n                                            prefix_sum[i][j])\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible bottom-right corners of submatrices\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                # Calculate the sum of submatrix from (0,0) to (i,j)\n                submatrix_sum = prefix_sum[i + 1][j + 1]\n                if submatrix_sum <= k:\n                    count += 1\n        \n        return count\n\n# Example:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.countSubmatrices([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], 4)) # Example test case\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** We compute a 2D prefix sum where `prefix_sum[i+1][j+1]` stores the sum of elements in the rectangle from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)`. This allows quick calculations of submatrix sums.\n- **Count Valid Submatrices:** By iterating over each potential bottom-right coordinate `(i, j)` of a submatrix (starting from `(0, 0)`), we determine the submatrix sum using the prefix sum and compare it to `k`. If it satisfies the condition, we increment the count.\n- **Edge Handling:** Ensure code handles edge cases such as empty matrices by an initial check at the beginning of the function."}

The goal is to make `t` lexicographically smallest while satisfying this condition.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution approach:\n\n1. **Character Distance**: We need to calculate the cyclic distance between two characters. Given two characters `s[i]` and `t[i]`, the distance is the minimum of the forward and backward distances in the alphabet. This can be computed as:\n   - `dist = min((ord(s[i]) - ord(t[i])) % 26, (ord(t[i]) - ord(s[i])) % 26)`\n\n2. **Greedily Build `t`**: Construct `t` by replacing each character of `s` with the smallest possible character (starting from 'a') until the constraint on the distance `k` allows it. This ensures that we achieve the lexicographically smallest result.\n\n3. **Iterate Through `s`**: For each character in `s`, calculate the possible distance if we replace it with a character `c` starting from 'a'. If substituting `c` would exceed the remaining `k`, we settle for a character changing from 'a' to a valid character that maintains the allowed `distance`.\n\nThe implementation of the above logic is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def getSmallestString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        n = len(s)\n        t = []\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Try to find the smallest character to put in t[i]\n            for c in range(26):\n                new_char = chr(ord('a') + c)\n                dist = min((ord(s[i]) - ord(new_char)) % 26, (ord(new_char) - ord(s[i])) % 26)\n                # Check if we can afford this change\n                if k >= dist:\n                    t.append(new_char)\n                    k -= dist\n                    break\n        \n        return ''.join(t)\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.getSmallestString(\"abc\", 3))  # Example output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- Iterate each character `s[i]` in the string `s`.\n- For each position, try replacing `s[i]` with the smallest possible character starting from 'a'.\n- Calculate the distance for each potential substitution, ensuring not to exceed the allowed change `k`.\n- If substituting a particular character is feasible within the allowed distance, accept it and move to the next character.\n- Stop when the entire string is processed or the `k` limit is met.\n- The solution returns the lexicographically smallest string, achieved by initially trying the smallest character, 'a', and only compromising when necessary."}

These are stored in a set called `substrings_of_length_2` to eliminate duplicates and to allow for fast membership testing later on.\n\n3. **Compare with reversed substrings:** Again, iterate through the reversed string to extract all substrings of length 2. For each substring extracted from the reversed string, check if it exists in `substrings_of_length_2`.\n\n4. **Return the result:** If any substring of length 2 from the reversed string matches a substring in the original string, we return `True`. If after going through all such substrings, no match is found, we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the presence of a common substring of length 2 between the original and reversed strings."}

{"idx": 174, "task_id": "special-array-i", "question": "An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.\nYou are given an array of integers nums. Return true if nums is a special array, otherwise, return false.\n \nPlease complete the following python code precisely:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n```", "answer": "To determine whether the given array is special, you need to check if each pair of adjacent elements in the array consists of numbers with different parity. That means one number should be even and the other should be odd in every adjacent pair.\n\nHere's how you can implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def isArraySpecial(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Check each pair of adjacent elements in the array\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            # If both have the same parity, return False\n            if nums[i] % 2 == nums[i + 1] % 2:\n                return False\n        # If all pairs have different parity, return True\n        return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Iteration:** You loop through each element in the array except the last one to compare with the next.\n  \n- **Parity Check:** You compare the parity of `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` using the modulus operator `%`.\n  - `nums[i] % 2` returns `0` if the number is even and `1` if it's odd.\n  - If both the current and next element have the same result (either both even or both odd), the array is not special, hence return `False`.\n\n- **Return True:** If you complete the loop without encountering two numbers of the same parity, the array is special.\n\nThis function efficiently checks the condition in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array, by using a single pass through the array."}
