This helps in efficiently finding the longest equal subarray starting from each index of a specific number.\n\n2. **Iterate through each number**: You iterate through each unique number (`num`) to determine the longest equal subarray starting at each of its indices.\n\n3. **Optimize with Sliding Window**: For each starting index of `num`, try to extend the subarray as far as possible by keeping track of required deletions.\n\n4. **Management of Deletions**:\n   - `left_deletions`: Counts the number of deletions allowed since the start of the subarray.\n   - `right_deletions`: Tracks the number of deletions allowed when considering the current index in the for-loop.\n   - As you move forward, if you encounter a new element (not `num`) increase `right_deletions` by 1.\n   - If you encounter an element equal to `num`, calculate the potential subarray length by checking `right_deletions`.\n\n5. **Early Exit**: If `right_deletions` becomes negative, the subarray cannot be extended to include the current index, meaning the start of the subarray must be moved forward to try a different starting index.\n\n6. **Update Max Length**: After processing each starting index, update `max_length` with the length of the longest valid subarray.\n\nThis method efficiently finds the longest equal subarray, leveraging the use of sliding windows and keeping track of deletions, ensuring it can efficiently process the problem. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray consisting of equal integers after removing at most `k` elements from `nums`. We can utilise a sliding window approach and maintain a sliding window `window` that contains only the current equal subarray.

We use a `count` dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of numbers in the window.\n\n2. **Expansion Strategy**: If at any point the current subarray is considered \"wider\" than it's most frequent element can accommodate by removing `k` elements, we contract the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Length**: After expanding the window, we track the length of the current considered equal subarray (`right - left + 1`) and update the maximum length if it exceeds the previously calculated length.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest equal subarray by leveraging a sliding window approach and ensures that we can only expand the window if we have enough \"space\" to maintain that it is still an equal subarray. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest equal subarray after deleting at most `k` elements from the given array `nums`. We can use a two-pointer technique, specifically a sliding window, with a frequency map to determine the largest subarray of the same integer in every possible window of varying lengths.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        count = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        left = 0\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n            # If the current window is longer than k, remove the count of the leftmost element\n            if right - left + 1 > k + max(count.values()):\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            # Update the maximum subarray length\n            max_len = max(max_len, count[nums[right]])\n        \n        return max_len\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sliding Window with Frequency Map**:\n   - We use a frequency map `count` to track how many times each number appears in the current window.\n   - We maintain a window that does not exceed `k` deletions.\n\n2. **Expanding the Window**:\n   - We expand the window by adding one element to the right.\n\n3. **Updating Frequency Map**:\n   - After adding a new element, if the window length exceeds `k + max(count.values())`, we remove the count of the leftmost element from the window and move the left pointer.\n\n4. **Calculate Max Length**:\n   - For any element in the window, the maximum length of its subarray would be the maximum number of times it appears in the current window.\n\nThis approach handles the deletion of elements by ensuring that each potential subarray appears within the constraints of `k` deletions. It efficiently finds the longest possible equal subarray by leveraging the sliding window technique and a frequency map to efficiently count occurrences. ", "To solve the problem of finding the longest possible equal subarray by deleting at most `k` elements from the given array, we can use a sliding window technique.

We also maintain the maximum count `max_count` in the current window.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**:\n   - We expand the window by moving the right pointer.\n   - For each new element, update the count of that element.\n   - Update the `max_count` to the maximum frequency of an element in the current window.\n\n3. **Checking Subarray Length**:\n   - If the difference between the current window size (`right - left + 1`) and the `max_count` is greater than `k`, it indicates that we can reduce the number of elements outside the current window to make them all equal.\n\n4. **Update the Result**:\n   - If the length of the current window is greater than the `max_length` seen so far, we update it.\n\n5. **Continuously Move the Window**:\n   - Move the left pointer to maintain a window that can be made equal by removing at most `k` elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest possible equal subarray by appropriately shrinking the window when necessary.

Whenever the size of the current valid subarray is longer than `longest_length`, it updates `longest_length`.\n\n- **Frequency Map**: We use a `defaultdict(int)` to track the frequency of each number in the current window.\n\n- **Delete Elements**: We need to ensure that the current window can be made equal by ensuring the difference of numbers in the window and the most frequent number is at most `k`. If that number is greater, we move the window to the right (by incrementing the end of the window) and adjust the frequency accordingly.\n\n- **Calculate Longest Length**: At each step, we update `longest_length` with the length of the largest window that can be made equal with up to `k` deletions.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest equal subarray by reducing the problem into a manageable sliding window calculation with a frequency map.

The condition we check is:\n   - If the size of the current window minus the most frequent element's frequency exceeds `k`, it implies the window is not balanced and we need to shrink it by moving the `left` pointer.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Length**: As we process each element, compute the current window size, which is `right - left + 1`, and update the maximum equal subarray size.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the length of the longest possible equal subarray without exceeding the deletion limit `k`.

The goal is to find the longest subarray where all elements are equal within the window.\n\n2. **Dictionary to Count Equality**: The sliding window will maintain a dictionary that maps each unique element in the current window to its count.\n\n3. **Maximum Count**: The dictionary will keep track of the maximum count of any given element within the window, ensuring we can detect when the number of changes (subtracting elements from our window) exceeds our maximum deletions allowed.\n\n4. **Window Shrinkage**: If the maximum count of any element in the current window is greater than `k`, then we need to shrink the window to maintain a valid subarray. This shrinking will require at most `k` deletions, as per the problem's constraint.\n\n5. **Sliding Update**: Update the maximum subarray length as you move the window to the right.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll iterate over the array, incrementing the count of each element as the window moves, tracking the maximum count of any element in the window.

The goal is to find the longest contiguous subarray within this window that contains all the same elements.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dictionary for frequency tracking\n        frequencies = defaultdict(int)\n        start = 0\n        max_length = 0\n        \n        for end in range(len(nums)):\n            # Add the current number to the frequencies\n            frequencies[nums[end]] += 1\n            \n            # Shrink the window if necessary\n            while (end - start + 1) - frequencies[nums[end]] > k:\n                frequencies[nums[start]] -= 1\n                start += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the length of the longest subarray\n            max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Window Size Maintenance**: We keep a sliding window that starts with index `start` and ends with index `end`. This window is adjusted to allow for at most `k` deletions. If the current window contains more deletions than allowed (`end - start + 1 - frequencies[nums[end]] > k`), we shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer to adjust the window to have at most `k` deletions.\n  \n- **Frequency Tracking**: We use a dictionary `frequencies` to track the frequency of each unique number in the current window.\n\n- **Update Maximum Length**: For each valid window, calculate its length `end - start + 1`, and update the maximum length found so far.\n\nThis problem demonstrates how the sliding window technique can be used to efficiently manage large amounts of data by using a window and keeping track of subarray properties efficiently under constraints. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest valid equal subarray after deleting at most `k` elements. An equal subarray is defined as a contiguous subarray where all elements are equal. We'll use a sliding window approach to solve this problem.\n\nThe idea is to keep track of how many elements are different from the current number. As we move the right pointer of the window, if the difference count exceeds `k`, we'll contract the window by moving the left pointer.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        max_count = 0\n        diff_count = 0\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        \n        while right < len(nums):\n            # Expand the window\n            freq[nums[right]] += 1\n            current_num = nums[right]\n            # The current number is different from itself\n            diff_count = max(diff_count, freq[nums[right]] - 1)\n            \n            # If the difference count is greater than k, contract the window\n            if diff_count > k:\n                freq[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            max_count = max(max_count, freq[current_num])\n            right += 1\n        \n        return max_count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sliding Window:**\n   - Use a sliding window approach where the left and right boundaries of the window represent a valid subarray.\n\n2. **Frequency Map:**\n   - Use a frequency map (`freq`) to count the occurrences of each element inside the current window.\n\n3. **Difference Count:**\n   - Maintain a variable `diff_count` to track how many elements are different from the current number.\n\n4. **Contract Window:**\n   - Whenever `diff_count` exceeds `k`, contract the window (i.e., move `left`) to reduce the length of the subarray.\n\n5. **Update Maximum Length:**\n   - Calculate the length of the subarray and update `max_count` when a longer valid subarray is found.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently computes the longest equal subarray in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input array. ", "To solve this problem, we need to find the longest consecutive subarray that has the same elements after up to `k` elements are removed. We can achieve this efficiently using a sliding window approach.\n\n1. **Setup**: We will use a two-pointer approach with a map to track the count of each number.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**:\n   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to form a window.\n   - Maintain a counter, `max_frequency`, that tracks the maximum frequency of any number in the current window.\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Subarray Length**:\n   - If the current window satisfies the condition of having equal elements after up to `k` elements being removed, update the maximum subarray length.\n\n4. **Expand the Window**:\n   - Move the window's right bound to expand the window.\n\n5. **Shrink the Window**:\n   - If the current window violates the condition (i.e., the frequency of the most frequent number in the window exceeds `k`), move the left bound to shrink the window.\n\n6. **Repeat**:\n   - Continue moving the right bound and adjusting the window's size conditionally using the left bound, until the right bound reaches the end of the list.\n\n7. **Return Result**:\n   - Return the length of the longest subarray with equal elements after the maximum number of removals.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        max_length = 0\n        left = 0\n        count = defaultdict(int) # Stores the count of each number in the current window\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            count[nums[right]] += 1\n            max_freq = max(count.values(), default=0)\n            \n            if right - left + 1 - max_freq > k:\n                # If the current window cannot become a valid subarray after deletion, shrink the window\n                count[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the length of the current valid subarray\n            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a sliding window technique to measure the length of subarrays.\n- Each time we move the right end of the window, we update `count` and determine the maximum frequency in the current window.\n- We then check if the current subarray length can be further expanded by checking if removing any element (`(current_window_size - max_frequency)`) is less than or equal to `k`.\n- If it is not, we move the left end of the window to reduce the window size.\n- We update `max_length` with the maximum possible subarray length found in this process.\n- Finally, we return `max_length`. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we aim to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same after removing at most $k$ elements from the array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Sliding Window with Maximum Frequency**: Use a sliding window technique to maintain a subarray where the frequency of the most common element within the window is maximized.\n\n2. **Formula for Expansion**: As we expand the window, the maximum possible length of the identical subarray is typically only constrained by the number of elements we can remove.\n\n3. **Maximize Length Expansion**: As we expand the window, use the formula:\n   - If the number of removals we can afford ($k$) is at least `length of current subarray`, then the new subarray can be extended.\n   - Otherwise, we need to reduce the window by adding a new element.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum Length**: Maintain a counter of the longest equal subarray found.\n\nNow let's implement the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        max_length = 0\n        freq_count = defaultdict(int)\n        start = 0\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            # Add the current element to the frequency counter\n            freq_count[nums[i]] += 1\n\n            # Expand the window if we can remove the same number of elements\n            max_freq = max(freq_count.values())\n            window_length = i - start + 1\n            if window_length - max_freq <= k:\n                max_length = max(max_length, max_freq)\n            else:\n                # If not enough removals, shrink the window\n                freq_count[nums[start]] -= 1\n                start += 1\n\n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **max_length**: Tracks the maximum length of the equal subarray.\n- **freq_count**: A dictionary to count the frequency of each element within the current window.\n- **start**: The start index of the current window.\n\nWe iterate through each element in the list with the sliding window approach:\n\n- Add the current element to the frequency count.\n- Calculate the maximum frequency of an element in the current window.\n- Check if we can expand the window by using the available removals.\n- If the expansion is valid, update `max_length`.\n- If the expansion becomes invalid (we need to shrink the window), decrease the count for the leftmost element by moving `start`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible subarrays by limiting the growth of the window by keeping a check on the available removals. ", "\nThis problem is similar to finding the longest subarray with the same value except you can delete at most `k` elements. We can leverage a sliding window approach to tackle this. The main idea is to expand the window as far as possible while using the allowed deletions to maintain the equality.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Sliding Window:** Maintain two pointers `i` and `j` that form a window.\n2. **Element Count:** Use a hash map to track the count of elements seen in the current window.\n3. **Maintain Equality:** Only expand the window if all elements are equal within the current window.\n4. **Delete at Most K Elements:** If the count of any element is greater than the maximum count in the window, we should remove the extra elements from the front of the window to maintain the desired equality.\n5. **Update the Longest Window:** Keep track of the maximum length of the subarray that satisfies the conditions.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize pointers and hash map\n        i, j = 0, 0\n        count = Counter()\n        max_len = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the array while maintaining a valid subarray\n        while j < len(nums):\n            # Increment the count of the current element\n            count[nums[j]] += 1\n            \n            # If the condition is violated by the current window\n            if j - i + 1 - max(count.values()) > k:\n                # Decrement count of nums[i] and move the left pointer\n                count[nums[i]] -= 1\n                i += 1\n            \n            # Update the longest subarray found\n            max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        \n        return max_len\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `i` and `j` are used to represent the start and end of our current window.\n- `count` is a dictionary that tracks the count of each element in the current window.\n- We iterate through the array `nums`, increasing the window size `j - i + 1` until our current window is valid.\n- We use `max(count.values())` to determine the current maximum value that any element in the current window can have, so we allow `j - i + 1 - max(count.values())` deletions.\n- Finally, we update the `max_len` to keep track of the longest valid subarray.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest subarray that can be made equal by deleting at most `k` elements.

We can achieve this using a sliding window technique. Here's a detailed explanation and the completed code:\n\n1. **Sliding Window Approach**:\n   - Use a two-pointer technique to maintain a window (`left` and `right`) within the array `nums`.\n   - Keep track of the frequency of the current subarray element under the window.\n   - As the window moves to the right, update the frequency and ensure the window doesn't have more than `k` elements which need to be removed.\n   - Maintain the maximum length of the subarray that is equal.\n\n2. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. The sliding window solution ensures we process all elements of the array by moving the window.\n   - Space Complexity: O(1), as we are tracking the frequency of the subarray elements and no additional data structures are used.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Use a dictionary to maintain the frequency of each number within the current window.\n   - For each element, determine the maximum number of instances of that element in the current window minus the number of deletions allowed.\n   - Maintain a variable to track the maximum such count of elements.\n\n4. **Code Implementation**:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        max_length = 0\n        \n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of each number in sliding window\n        freq = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        left = 0\n        # Maintain a sliding window [left, right]\n        for right in range(n):\n            # Increment frequency of this number in the window\n            freq[nums[right]] += 1\n            \n            # Determine how many elements can be removed from this window\n            max_frequency = max(freq.values())\n            max_possible_deletions = (right - left + 1) - max_frequency\n            \n            # If we can't remove more than k elements, move the left pointer\n            if max_possible_deletions > k:\n                freq[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Update max_length\n            max_length = max(max_length, max_frequency)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sliding Window**: We iterate over each element of `nums` using a sliding window `[left, right]`. The loop ends when the right pointer reaches the end of the array.\n  \n- **Frequency Tracking**: We use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of elements currently in the window.\n\n- **Calculate Possible Deletions**: For each element, the number of deletions possible equals `(right - left + 1) - max_frequency`. If this exceeds `k`, we adjust the size of the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right. This is maintained while ensuring the number of deletions doesn't exceed `k` for the subarray bounded by `[left, right]`.\n\n- **Update Maximum Length**: We keep track of the maximum window length that can be formed by all elements being equal within the current window.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the longest possible equal subarray after up to `k` deletions, utilizing a sliding window approach to evaluate the conditions efficiently.

", "To solve the problem of finding the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most `k` elements from the input array `nums`, we can use a sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a count of the frequency of each number in the current window and track the maximum count of any number. By using this count, we can adjust the window's size to make sure there are not more than `k` elements to be removed in order to have all numbers in the subarray equal.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        longest_length = 1\n        left = 0\n        # This dictionary will count the frequency of numbers in the current window\n        frequency = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            # Add the current element to the frequency count\n            frequency[nums[right]] += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the maximum frequency in the current window\n            max_frequency = max(frequency.values())\n            \n            # The window size is (right - left + 1)\n            window_size = right - left + 1\n            \n            # If the window size exceeds 'k + max_frequency', we need to shrink the window\n            if window_size > k + max_frequency:\n                # Decrease the count of the element at the left end of the window\n                frequency[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Update the longest length of an equal subarray\n            longest_length = max(longest_length, max_frequency)\n        \n        return longest_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Defaultdict Initialization**: We use `defaultdict(int)` instead of a regular dictionary because it ensures that we have a default value of 0 for non-existent keys, making it easier to count frequencies.\n2. **Sliding Window**: We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the current subarray.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: For each `nums[right]` encountered, increase the frequency count.\n4. **Finding the Maximum Frequency**: After adding a new element to the window, calculate the maximum frequency of any number in the current window.\n5. **Window Size Management**: If the current window size (i.e., `right - left + 1`) exceeds `k + max_frequency`, shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer until the window is valid again.\n6. **Updating Maximum Size**: Record the maximum size of any valid subarray formed during this process and return it.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the longest possible equal subarray by adjusting the size of the window to ensure it contains at most `k` elements different from the majority element.

Note that the empty subarray is an equal subarray.\nReturn the length of the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most k elements from nums.\nA subarray is a contiguous, possibly empty sequence of elements within an array.\n \nPlease complete the following python code precisely:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n```", "answer": "```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Counter to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window\n        cnt = Counter()\n        \n        # Left pointer for the sliding window\n        l = 0\n        \n        # Variable to store the maximum length of a subarray with equal elements after deletions\n        mx = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the array with the right pointer\n        for r, x in enumerate(nums):\n            # Increment the count for the current element in the window\n            cnt[x] += 1\n            \n            # Update the maximum frequency found in the current window\n            mx = max(mx, cnt[x])\n            \n            # If the window size minus the maximum frequency exceeds k (meaning we need to delete\n            # more than k elements to make the subarray equal), shrink the window from the left\n            if r - l + 1 - mx > k:\n                # Decrement the count for the element at the left of the window\n                cnt[nums[l]] -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window\n                l += 1\n        \n        # The length of the longest equal subarray after deleting at most k elements\n        return mx\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We utilize a `Counter` to track element frequencies in the considered window.\n   - Two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), mark the window boundaries for the subarray.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - We iterate over `nums` using the `enumerate` function to get both index `r` and value `x`.\n   - We increment the count of `x` in the current window.\n   - Update `mx`, which tracks the highest frequency of any single number within the window.\n\n3. **Condition Check and Shrink Window**:\n   - Check if the number of elements needed to be deleted (`r - l + 1 - mx`) exceeds `k`.\n   - If it does, move the left pointer `l` to the right, maintaining the property that at most `k` deletions are needed to make the subarray equal.\n   - Decrement the count of the element at the left pointer as it is no longer in the window.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - The maximum value of `mx` encountered gives the length of the longest subarray where elements can be equal after removing at most `k` elements.", "response_number": 0, "code_list": ["from collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dictionary to store the last index of each element\n        last_index = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        # Store the last index of each element\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            last_index[num].append(i)\n        \n        # Iterate through each distinct number\n        max_length = 0\n        for num in set(nums):\n            indices = last_index[num]\n            \n            # Optimize length of subarray starting at each index of the number\n            for start in indices:\n                left_deletions = k\n                j = start\n                while j < len(nums) and left_deletions >= 0:\n                    if j == start:\n                        # Start a new subarray starting at this index\n                        right_deletions = k\n                    else:\n                        # Calculate required deletions to include this index\n                        if nums[j] == num:\n                            right_deletions = max(0, right_deletions -

The condition we ки  check is:\n   - If the size of the current window minus the most frequent element's frequency exceeds `k`, it implies the window is not balanced and we need to shrink it by moving the `left` pointer.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Length**: As we process ки  each element, compute ки  the current window size, which is `right - left + 1`, and update the maximum equal subarray size ки .\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the length of the longest possible equal subarray without ки  exceeding the deletion limit `k`.  ки ", "To solve this problem, we'll leverage a sliding window technique with a dictionary to keep track of the longest subarray for each unique element in the array.

If a number ки ' ки s frequency falls below or ки  exceeds the frequency of elements ки  in the current window without ки  using more than `k` deletions, we decrease ки  the window size.\n\nWe ки 'll use a dictionary to track the frequency of numbers within the current window. The goal is to maintain a window with elements where ки  the frequency of any number is at least the maximum frequency of the other numbers in the window.\n\nHere's how the code would look:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        max_length = 0\n        freq = defaultdict(int)  # To track frequencies of elements\n        left = 0\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            # Add the current number to the frequency count\n            freq[nums[right]] += 1\n            \n            # If the current number ки 's frequency exceeds the maximum frequency\n            # of all other numbers in the window\n            while (right - left + 1) * max(freq.values()) > (right - left + ки  k + 1):\n                # If ки  so ки , reduce the window size by moving the left pointer\n                freq[nums[left]] -= 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Update the max_length with the current window length\n            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `max_length`: Stores the maximum length of any ки  valid subarray meeting ки  the condition of being of ки  the same value.\n   - `freq`: A dictionary to track the frequency of each integer ки  in the current window.\n   - `left`: The start of the sliding window.\n\n2. **Iterate over the array**:\n   - For each element `nums[right]`, add it to the frequency dictionary.\n   - Maintain a window such that the condition (`(right - left + 1) * max(freq.values())`) becomes ки  true by checking ки  if the frequency ки  of any number is greater than the maximum frequency of any other number in the window.\n   - Re ки peat this process by moving the `left` pointer if necessary.  ки \n\n3. **Update `max_length`**:\n   - After each iteration, update `max_length` by checking the current window size, which includes ки  the window ки  grown ки  to `right` and ки  shrunk to `left` if ки  necessary.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the longest subarray with the same value while handling ки  deletions effectively.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subarray of equal elements that can be formed after at most `k` elements are deleted from `nums`. A window ки  approach will be suitable. We will use a sliding window, ки  sliding ки  over the `nums` list, keeping track of the maximum subarray length for each unique number within the window.

The sliding window maintains a window of elements from `nums[left]` to `nums[right]`.\n  - We use a map ( ки `num_count`) to store ки  the count of each number in the window.\n  - A frequency array (`freq_count`) helps to quickly determine the maximum frequency of elements in the current window.\n\n- **Calculating Deletions**:\n  - ` ки elements_to_delete` is calculated as `right - left + 1` (current window size) minus `max_freq` (maximum frequency of any number in the current window).\n  - If `elements_to_delete` is greater than `k`, contract the window by removing elements from the left side of the current window.\n\n- **Cont ки raction**:\n  - As elements are removed from the left side, the frequency count is updated and `max_freq` is recalculated.\n\n- **Result**:\n  - Each ки  time a valid subarray is found (i.e., `max_freq`), the length is updated.\n  - The final result is the maximum length found throughout the process.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest subarray that can be made equal after deleting at most `k` elements from the array.  ки \n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Sliding Window Approach**:\n   - We maintain ки  a frequency ки  map of the elements in a window.\n   - Use a sliding window to check ки  for equal subarrays, ки  adjusting the size of the window to accommodate for the possible ки  deletions (`k`).\n   - The length of the longest equal subarray will be adjusted ки  as we expand the window.\n\n2. **Implementation**:\n   - Use a frequency map `freq` to keep track of the number of times each element appears in the current window.\n   - Use a variable `max_len ки ` to store the length of the longest equal subarray found.\n   - Use a single ки  pass to expand the window and adjust the `freq` map accordingly:\n     - If the number of different values ки  in the window is less than or equal to `k`, expand the window and update `max_len` if the window length is greater than the previous maximum.\n     - If the number of different values is greater than `k`, shrink the window by decreasing ки  the frequency of the element at the left end of the window and moving the left end of the window forward.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**:\n   -

This involves identifying the frequency ки  of each unique number in the subarray and using ки  a sliding window approach.\n\nThe idea is to use a sliding window that expands and contracts based on the number of elements we can remove. For each window, we will ки  keep track of the maximum frequency of any number in the current window. If the current window length minus the maximum frequency is greater than `k`, we move the start of the window forward, updating ки  the frequencies when ки  elements are removed.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing this solution ки :\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestEqualSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        max_length = 0\n        start = 0\n        frequency = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        for end in range(n):\n            frequency[nums[end]] += 1\n            max_freq = max(frequency.values())\n            \n            # If we can remove ' ки k' elements, move the start of the window\n            if end - start + 1 - max_freq > k:\n                frequency[nums[start]] -= 1\n                start += 1\n            \n            max_length = max(max_length, max_freq)\n        \n        return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize `max_length` to zero to keep track of the largest ки  length of an equal subarray found.\n   - `start` is used to manage ки  the start of the sliding window.\n   - `frequency` dictionary helps us keep track of the frequency of each number in the current window.\n    ки \n2. **Search ки ing for Longest Subarray**:\n   - We iterate through the array `nums` and for each element:\n     - Increment the frequency of the current element.\n     - Compute the maximum frequency of any element in the current window.\n     - If the current window's size minus the maximum frequency is greater than `k`, reduce ки  the window size by moving the start forward.\n   - Keep track of the ` ки max_length` as the longest possible subarray per ки  iteration.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - After processing all elements, `max_length` will hold the length of the largest ки  valid ки  equal subarray after the removal of up to `k` elements.\n\nThis approach safely ки  elimin ки ates the need for nested loops and ensures we correctly ки  consider ки  all possible equal subarrays while keeping ки  an ки  optimal time complexity.  ки ", "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest subarray that can be made equal after at most `k` elements are deleted.

{"idx": 1, "pred": ["\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of servers that did not receive any requests during each time interval of size `x`. \n\nOne approach involves using a sliding window over the logs with each window starting at each query time within the `x` interval. For each interval, we maintain a set to keep track of the unique servers that have been active in the current query window. This set will efficiently determine if a server has an active activity within that window.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by their time for easier processing\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary to track the number of servers at each time\n        active_servers = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Set to track unique servers during the current interval\n        current_servers = set()\n        \n        result = []\n        j = 0\n        \n        # Process each query time:\n        for i, query in enumerate(queries):\n            # Adjust the active servers windows based on the current query\n            while j < len(logs) and logs[j][1] <= query - x:\n                _, time = logs[j]\n                if active_servers[time] == 1:\n                    current_servers.remove(logs[j][0])\n                active_servers[time] -= 1\n                j += 1\n            \n            # Add the current query's start time as a possible candidate\n            current_servers.add(logs[j][0])\n            active_servers[logs[j][1]] += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that did not receive requests\n            count = n - len(current_servers)\n            result.append(count)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sort Logs**: Sort the log entries by the time to simplify the problem of counting servers in any given interval.\n\n2. **Active Servers**: We use a dictionary `active_servers` to keep track of the number of servers that have been active at a specific time.

", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of servers that did not receive any request for a certain time interval. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we will approach the problem:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs and Queries by Time:** Start by sorting the logs (to facilitate efficient binary search) and the queries array (to accommodate the interval queries).\n\n2. **Use a Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window to determine the number of servers that did not receive requests during the past `x` seconds of each query.\n\n3. **Count active servers:**\n   - Use a dictionary to track active servers, maintaining a list of logs where the server was active.\n   - Use a pointer `i` to iterate through the logs, maintaining a deque of active servers with their `server_id` and `time`.\n   - Use a counter `active_servers_count` to keep track of the total number of active servers.\n\n4. **Maintain the deque:**\n   - During each iteration, check if the current `server_id` has been active for more than `x` seconds (using the `deque.back.time` since it is sorted by time). If it has, remove the server from the deque and decrement `active_servers_count`.\n   - Insert the current server into the deque and increment `active_servers_count`.\n\n5. **Compute the Result for Each Query:**\n   - Iterate through each query and use binary search to find the first occurrence of a server whose last activity is more than `x` seconds before the current query.\n   - Use the `active_servers_count` to determine how many servers were not active during the query interval.\n\n6. **Return the Results:**\n   - Keep track of the results for each query in a list and return it after processing all queries.\n\nHere is the complete code for the `countServers` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs\n        logs.sort()\n        # Sort the queries\n        queries.sort()\n        \n        # Dictionary to store the last active time for each server\n        server_last_active_time = {}\n        # Deque to store active servers sorted by their last active time\n        active_servers = collections.deque()\n        # Total number of active servers\n        active_servers_count = 0\n        \n        # List to store the results for each query\n        results = []\n        \n        i = 0  # Index for iterating through the logs\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Find the first log that is after the query - x\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query - x:\n                to_remove = logs[i][0]\n                # Remove the server from the active list\n                while active_servers and active_servers[0][0] == to_remove:\n                    active_servers.popleft()\n                i += 1\n            \n            # Check if there are any servers active\n            if i > 0:\n                # If there are any servers active, then for any server that is active for more than x, it cannot be active\n                # for the current query\n                while active_servers and active_servers[-1][1] + x < query:\n                    active_servers_count -= 1\n                    active_servers.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current query's server to the active list\n            if server_last_active_time.get(logs[i][0], -1) != query:\n                server_last_active_time[logs[i][0]] = query\n                active_servers_count += 1\n                active_servers.append((logs[i][0], query))\n            \n            # The number of active servers at the current time is the answer for the current query\n            results.append(n - active_servers_count)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting and Binary Search**: Sorting helps in quickly finding servers that did not receive any requests during the interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`.\n\n- **Deque and Counter**: Use a dictionary to keep track of servers' last active times and a deque to manage active servers efficiently.\n\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window to maintain active servers and their usages in the given time intervals.\n\nThis approach ensures the efficient calculation of the number of servers that did not receive any requests within the desired interval, efficiently leveraging binary search and deque operations to maintain active servers efficiently. ", "\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of servers that did not receive any requests during each query interval, we can use a data structure that efficiently counts the number of distinct elements within a given “time window”. The key idea is to use a sliding window technique, where we maintain a counter of the number of occurrences of each server in a certain time range.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Sort the `queries` array in ascending order.\n2. Sort the `logs` array by time.\n3. Use a sliding window technique to count occurrences of servers withing each query interval.\n4. Use a dictionary `server_count` to keep track of each server and their frequency of occurrence in the current window.\n5. Use a set `active_servers` to keep track of servers whose count falls within the current window.\n6. For each query, slide the window to include only servers active at that time, and then count how many servers are not in `active_servers`.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the queries in ascending order\n        queries.sort()\n        \n        # Sort the logs based on time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary to store the count of each server's occurrence in the current window\n        server_count = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Set to hold active servers\n        active_servers = set()\n        \n        # Pointers to track the logs and queries\n        log_idx = 0\n        query_idx = 0\n        \n        # To store the output of each query\n        result = []\n        \n        # Iterate through all queries\n        while query_idx < len(queries):\n            # Timestamp of the query\n            curr_time = queries[query_idx]\n            \n            # Move the log pointer to the right\n            while log_idx < len(logs) and logs[log_idx][1] <= curr_time - x:\n                # Remove servers that fall outside the current window\n                server_count[logs[log_idx][0]] -= 1\n                if server_count[logs[log_idx][0]] == 0:\n                    active_servers.remove(logs[log_idx][0])\n                log_idx += 1\n            \n            # Add new servers to the set\n            while log_idx < len(logs) and logs[log_idx][1] <= curr_time:\n                # Update count of servers in the current window\n                server_count[logs[log_idx][0]] += 1\n                if server_count[logs[log_idx][0]] == 1:\n                    active_servers.add(logs[log_idx][0])\n                log_idx += 1\n            \n            # Compute and record the answer for the current query\n            servers_not_active = n - len(active_servers)\n            result.append(servers_not_active)\n            \n            # Move the query pointer\n            query_idx += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: First, we sort the `queries` to process them efficiently. This helps us determine at which point each query falls within the current time window.\n- **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window to keep track of servers active at any point within the window `[curr_time - x, curr_time]`. We use a dictionary `server_count` to efficiently keep track of the count of each server, and a set `active_servers` to keep track of servers in the current window.\n- **Dynamic Update**: As we move through the logs, we update both `server_count` and `active_servers`.\n- **Calculation**: We calculate the number of servers not active and append them to the result list.\n- **Complexity**: The main time complexity will come from sorting, which is O(n log n). The sliding window technique takes O(n) time to process each query. Overall, the solution runs in O(n log n) time complexity.

This allows us to efficiently manage counts for each time interval.\n\n2. **Process each query**: For each query, determine how many servers did not receive any requests during the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`. This can be done by removing the count of servers from the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i] - x]` and adjusting for any re-appearances of servers.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs to process them efficiently\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Use a dictionary to store the count of servers at each log time\n        time_count = Counter()\n        \n        # Start and end index for processing the logs\n        start = 0\n        end = 0\n        \n        # List to store the result\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove any servers that received a request before query - x\n            for i in range(start, end):\n                time_count[logs[i][1]] -= 1\n            \n            # Advance start to exclude logs that are at or before query - x\n            while logs[start][1] < query - x:\n                start += 1\n            \n            # Advance end to include logs that are at or before query\n            while end < len(logs) and logs[end][1] <= query:\n                time_count[logs[end][1]] += 1\n                end += 1\n            \n            # count of servers that received no requests during the last x seconds\n            no_requests = n - sum(1 for val in time_count.values() if val > 0)\n            result.append(no_requests)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: Use the sorted logs to efficiently process each query.\n- **Dynamically manage the sliding window**: We use two pointers `start` and `end` to manage the count of logs in the current window.\n- **Count Utilization**: The `time_count` dictionary is used to map each time to how many servers received requests at that time.\n- **Calculation**: For each query, adjust the `time_count` dictionary and compute the number of servers that did not receive any requests.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes each query in O(log n + m) time complexity, where `n` is the number of distinct logs and `m` is the number of queries, making it suitable for large inputs.

Using a dictionary (or a defaultdict), we store the latest time each server interacted with.\n2. **Sort by Time**: We reason about the queries in a sorted manner since the intervals we are considering are all related to the time.\n3. **Construct a Range**: We maintain a range of `[current_time - x, current_time]`, where `current_time` is the newest time that we are examining.\n4. **Count Active Servers**: For each query `t`, we count the number of servers that were active during this range.\n5. **Update Range**: When considering the next query `t+1`, we extend the range by 1.\n\nHere is the completed code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Group logs by server and get the latest time each server interacted\n        logs_by_server: Dict[int, int] = defaultdict(int)\n        for server, time in logs:\n            logs_by_server[server] = time\n\n        # Sort queries to make range processing easier\n        sorted_queries = sorted(queries)\n        \n        # This set will store the servers that are active at a given time\n        active_servers = set()\n        \n        # This dictionary will store the number of servers active at each time\n        active_servers_by_time = defaultdict(int)\n\n        # Function to update active servers based on the current time\n        def update_active_servers(current_time: int):\n            # Remove servers that are no longer active (those that haven't interacted for x time)\n            for server in list(active_servers):\n                if logs_by_server[server] < current_time - x:\n                    active_servers.remove(server)\n                    active_servers_by_time[current_time] -= 1\n\n        # Initially update active_servers with all servers that have been active at time 0\n        for server in logs_by_server:\n            if logs_by_server[server] >= 0:\n                active_servers.add(server)\n            active_servers_by_time[0] += 1\n\n        # Process queries to calculate the result\n        results = []\n        current_query_idx = 0\n        current_time = 0\n\n        for t in sorted_queries:\n            # Update active servers first\n            update_active_servers(t)\n\n            # Move the interval forward\n            current_time = t\n\n            # Count active servers in the interval\n            results.append(active_servers_by_time[t] - active_servers_by_time[t - x])\n\n            # Update active servers\n            if t in logs_by_server:\n                active_servers.add(t)\n                active_servers_by_time[t + 1] += 1\n\n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a dictionary `logs_by_server` to keep track of the latest time each server interacted with.\n- A set `active_servers` helps us quickly identify which servers are currently active.\n- A dictionary `active_servers_by_time` keeps track of how many servers were active at each time step (for updating purposes).\n- We maintain the current time `current_time`, which is updated for each query and used to determine which servers are active.\n- The `update_active_servers` function checks which servers are no longer active and adjusts the sets and dictionaries accordingly.\n- We calculate the result for each query by considering the interval between `current_time` and `current_time - x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks server activity with a time complexity of O(n log(n) + m log(m)), where n is the number of servers (`n` in `logs`) and m is the number of queries (`m` in `queries`).

This allows us to easily check for unique servers and their frequency.\n- The `count` dictionary is used to count the frequency of server IDs.\n- By keeping track of server IDs in the deque, we ensure the complexity of finding servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval is O(1).\n- The overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting plus O(n x q) for each query, where n is the number of logs and q is the number of queries, due to the sliding window.

The window starts from `queries[i] - x` and ends at `queries[i]`.\n   - Use a counter to keep track of how many servers are active in the current window.\n\n3. **Result List:**\n   - For each query, append the count of servers that are active within that window.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda l: l[1])  # Sort logs by time\n        query_times = queries[:]  # Make a copy of the query times\n        \n        # Binary search tree to efficiently manage the active server counts\n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        # To map each server to its index within logs\n        server_to_index = {server_id: i for i, [server_id, _] in enumerate(logs)}\n        \n        result = []\n        \n        # Iterate through the queries\n        for query in sorted(query_times):\n            # Find the first server that is not active before query - x\n            start_index = server_to_index[logs[0][0]]\n            for i in range(start_index, len(logs)):\n                if logs[i][1] > query - x:\n                    break\n                active_servers.add(logs[i][0])\n            \n            # Find the first server that is not active after query\n            end_index = server_to_index[logs[0][0]]\n            for i in range(end_index, len(logs)):\n                if logs[i][1] > query:\n                    break\n                active_servers.discard(logs[i][0])\n            \n            # Count the active servers in this window\n            result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We first sort `logs` by time to efficiently handle the sliding window and binary search on the active servers.\n- We use a binary search tree, `SortedList`, to efficiently manage the active servers within the window.\n- For each query, the sliding window is reduced by keeping only servers that are active within `queries[i] - x` to `queries[i]`.\n- Each time a server is added or removed from the active servers, update the result accordingly.\n", "\n- **Solution Explanation:**\n  - For each `query`, we need to count the number of servers that never received any requests during the time window `[query - x, query]`.\n  - This problem can be decomposed into managing a sliding window that keeps track of server request activity within the given time window.\n\n- **Approach Overview:**\n  - The approach involves maintaining a `Counter` to track usage of each server within the window using a monotonic deque (`deque`).\n  - We use a deque to efficiently insert and remove elements from both ends by utilizing a double-ended queue (deque). This allows us to efficiently manage our window's usage count.\n  - The goal is to maintain usage counts in the deque to rapidly evaluate the counts for each query in the given `queries` array.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  1. **Sort Logs:** Sort the logs by time to efficiently access the most recent server activity.\n  2. **Window Preparation:** Use a monotonic deque (`count_deque`) to track server usage in the time window.\n  3. **Query Evaluation:** For each given query, calculate the desired output by deleting all servers that are no longer in the time window and counting the remaining servers.\n\nHere is the complete code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        logs = sorted(logs, key=lambda l: l[1])  # Sort logs by time\n        ans = []\n        \n        # Monotonically decreasing deque to track server usage count\n        count_deque = deque()\n        count = Counter()\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # First, remove intervals that are outside the current query window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] + x <= query:\n                server, _ = logs.pop(0)\n                # If the server count in the deque is greater than 1, need to update\n                if count_deque and count_deque[0] == server:\n                    count[server] -= 1\n                    if count[server] == 0:\n                        count_deque.popleft()\n                else:\n                    count[server] -= 1\n            \n            # Second, add new intervals in the current query window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] <= query:\n                server, _ = logs.pop(0)\n                count_deque.append(server)\n                count[server] += 1\n            \n            # Answer for the current query\n            ans.append(n - len(count_deque))\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting:** Sorting the `logs` based on the time helps us quickly retrieve the most recent requests within the given time window without additional effort.\n- **Deque:** The `count_deque` is used to maintain a chronological order of the servers who are in the current time window.

", "\nTo solve the problem, we'll use a sliding window and a data structure to efficiently count the number of unique servers that did not receive any requests within a specified time interval. Here's how you can implement the solution:\n\n1. **Data Structure for Sliding Window:** We'll use a sorted list of tuples (time, server_id) to efficiently handle the sliding window and efficiently retrieve the `server_ids` that are active (not excluded from the window) at any query time.\n\n2. **Counting:**\n   - For each query time, calculate the start and end of the time interval ([query_time - x, query_time]).\n   - Calculate all `server_ids` that have at least one request between these query start and end times.\n   - Count the number of distinct `server_ids` which are not in this overlap.\n\n3. **Implementation:** Here's the Python code implementing the above:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Convert logs to sorted list of tuples (time, server_id)\n        sorted_logs = sorted(logs)\n        \n        # Initialize a sorted list to manage active server ids\n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        # A set to store the number of active servers for each query\n        active_servers_query = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Calculate the start and end of the query time interval\n            start_time = query - x\n            end_time = query\n            \n            # Remove servers that are no longer in the query window\n            while active_servers and active_servers[0][0] < start_time:\n                active_servers.pop(0)\n            \n            # Count the distinct servers in the query window\n            active_servers_query.append(n - len(set(server_id for _, server_id in active_servers)))\n            \n            # Add current query time to the sorted list of active servers\n            active_servers.add((query, sorted_logs[i][1]))\n        \n        return active_servers_query\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting:** First, we sort the `logs` to handle the window efficiently.\n- **Data Structure:** We use a `SortedList` to efficiently manage the active servers during each time interval.\n- **Main Loop:** For each query time, we remove all entries that are outside of the current window by popping from the start of the `active_servers`. Then, we count the number of unique servers not included in the window, by taking the difference of the number of servers and the number of unique servers in the active window.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem due to the sorted nature of the logs and the sorted list of active servers, making it an ideal choice for this problem. ", "To solve the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specified time interval, we can approach it as follows:\n\n1. **Server Timestamps**: First, we can take a look at the timestamps associated with each server and arrange them in ascending order. This allows us to easily determine when the servers were last active.\n\n2. **Queries with Timestamps**: For each query time, we need to identify how many servers were not active during that time interval. This can be determined by counting the number of servers that were inactive (active during the query interval minus the number of servers that became active during this interval).\n\n3. **Heap Data Structure**: To efficiently count these server states, we can use a heap to efficiently track the currently active servers. Every time we move forward in time, we adjust this heap based on the timestamps of the servers.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Queries**: For each query, adjust the heap and calculate the number of servers not active at the time of the query.

", "Here's a Python function to handle the problem of counting the number of servers that had no requests in a given interval. The solution is based on a segment tree. \n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Segment Tree**: A segment tree is used to efficiently manage the time range intervals. It helps in answering the question whether a server has received any request in a given time interval.\n\n- **Segment Tree Node**: Each node keeps a list of servers that received a request during the current interval.\n\n- **Segment Tree Construction**: We construct the segment tree by processing each log in sequence and adding the server to the interval list.\n\n- **Queries**: Each query is mapped to a time interval of the form [t - x, t], where `t` is the query time and `x` is the query duration. By using the segment tree, we count how many servers have at least one request during the interval.\n\n### Algorithm:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a list `server_requests` to maintain the indexes of servers that have received requests during a fixed time interval. Initially, its size is set to `n`, where indexes correspond to server ids.\n   - The `SegmentTree` is initialized with the size of `n`, which corresponds to the number of servers.\n\n2. **Sort the Logs**:\n   - Sort the logs by query time to efficiently make use of the segment tree.\n\n3. **Segment Tree Construction**:\n   - Process each log in the sorted order.\n   - For each log, update the segment tree to add the server to the list of servers that received requests during the time interval.\n\n4. **Query Processing**:\n   - For each query time, identify the time interval: `[t - x, t]`.\n   - Use the segment tree to count the number of servers that have at least one request in the given time interval.\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - Each query result is stored in a list and returned.\n\nHere is the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass SegmentTree:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.tree = defaultdict(list)\n        self.n = n\n\n    def update(self, start, end, index):\n        self.update_helper(0, self.n - 1, start, end, 0, index)\n\n    def update_helper(self, start, end, left, right, idx, index):\n        if start > right or end < left:\n            return\n\n        if start >= left and end <= right:\n            self.tree[idx].append(index)\n            return\n\n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        left_idx = 2 * idx + 1\n        right_idx = 2 * idx + 2\n\n        self.update_helper(start, mid, left, right, left_idx, index)\n        self.update_helper(mid + 1, end, left, right, right_idx, index)\n\n    def query(self, start, end):\n        return self.query_helper(0, self.n - 1, start, end, 0)\n\n    def query_helper(self, start, end, left, right, idx):\n        if start > right or end < left:\n            return set()\n\n        if start >= left and end <= right:\n            return set(self.tree[idx])\n\n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        left_idx = 2 * idx + 1\n        right_idx = 2 * idx + 2\n\n        return (self.query_helper(start, mid, left, right, left_idx) |\n                self.query_helper(mid + 1, end, left, right, right_idx))\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Initialize segment tree with n leaves\n        segment_tree = SegmentTree(n)\n        \n        # Sort logs by time to process segments efficiently\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        result = []\n        \n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Get the time interval for the query: [query_time - x, query_time]\n            start_time = query_time - x\n            end_time = query_time\n            \n            # Use segment tree to find the number of servers active in this interval\n            active_servers = segment_tree.query(start_time, end_time)\n            result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n            \n            # Update the segment tree for the active servers in the current interval\n            for server_id in active_servers:\n                segment_tree.update(0, n - 1, server_id)\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.countServers(n, logs, x, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SegmentTree Class**: The `SegmentTree` class implements the basic operations to manage segments of the range. Each node maintains a list of servers that have received requests during the corresponding time interval.\n\n- **SegmentTree Construction**: We process each log as it's sorted by time, updating the segment tree with the corresponding server index for each log's time range.\n\n- **Queries**: For each query, identify the interval `[query_time - x, query_time]` and use the segment tree to determine how many servers are active in this interval, which can be represented by their indexes.\n\n- **Result**: The result is stored in a list `result` and returned after processing all queries. ", "To solve the problem of calculating the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specific time interval, we can utilize a sliding window approach with a set to track which servers have sent requests in the given time window.\n\nThe idea is to maintain a set of server IDs that have sent requests in the current time window, and add them to a count. Once the window reaches the end of a query, remove any server IDs that are no longer in the window, and continue with the next query. \n\nHere's the complete implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by the time, which allows us to process them in order\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary to map each server ID to the last time it sent a request\n        server_times = {server: -1 for server in range(1, n + 1)}\n        \n        # Set to store server IDs during the current sliding window\n        current_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        result = []\n        query_index = 0\n\n        for query in queries:\n            # Find the start of the current query window\n            start_time = query - x\n            \n            # Remove server IDs from the set if they are no longer in the window\n            while current_servers and current_servers[0][1] < start_time:\n                server = current_servers[0][0]\n                current_servers.remove([server, server_times[server]])\n\n            # Add new logs until we reach the end of the current query window\n            while query_index < len(logs) and logs[query_index][1] <= query:\n                server, time = logs[query_index]\n                current_servers.add([server, time])\n                server_times[server] = time\n                query_index += 1\n\n            # The number of servers not receiving requests is n minus the size of current_servers\n            result.append(n - len(current_servers))\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.countServers(3, [[1, 3], [2, 6], [1, 5]], 5, [5, 6]))  # Example call\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We first sort the logs by the time they occur in order to process them efficiently.\n\n2. **Server Time Dictionary**: This dictionary tracks the last time each server sent a request.\n\n3. **Sliding Window**: We use `SortedList` to efficiently maintain the active servers during the current window.\n\n4. **Iterative Processing**: \n   - We process each query one by one. For each query, start by removing server IDs that are not in the current window (i.e., whose last request was before `query - x`).\n   - Then, process all logs that happened within the window, updating the `current_servers` and `server_times` dictionaries.\n   - Finally, the number of servers not receiving requests is the difference between `n` and the size of `current_servers`.\n\n5. **Result**: By storing the results for each query one by one, we ensure that the results are calculated efficiently. ", "1. **Sort Logs by Time**: First, let's sort the logs by their timestamp. This will allow us to easily process intervals based on the time.\n\n2. **Track Counter of Server Requests**: Use a counter to track the number of servers that have received requests in the current window over the entire query time range.\n\n3. **Use a Priority Queue to Maintain Active Servers**: Maintain a priority queue to keep track of the active servers within the current window. As the window slides, ensure that the queue is updated to ensure active servers at the current time interval are removed and new servers are added as needed.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Queries**: For each interval query, calculate the number of active servers using the count of the priority queue.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])  # Sort by time\n        \n        # Defaultdict to track server IDs and their latest query time\n        server_last_query = defaultdict(list)\n        # Priority queue to track the server IDs with the latest requests\n        pq = deque()\n        \n        # Dictionary to track the number of active servers at each query time\n        response = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Current query index\n        query_index = 0\n        \n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Expire servers from the query window\n            while pq and query_time - pq[0][0] > x:\n                server_id, last_query_time = pq.popleft()\n                # Update server_last_query[server_id] to the latest time it was queried\n                server_last_query[server_id] = last_query_time\n            \n            # Add new servers to the queue\n            while query_index < len(logs) and logs[query_index][1] <= query_time:\n                server_id, cur_time = logs[query_index]\n                # Update the last time it was queried for this server\n                server_last_query[server_id] = cur_time\n                # Ensure the queue is kept at max size n\n                pq.append((cur_time, server_id))\n                if len(pq) > n:\n                    pq.popleft()\n                query_index += 1\n            \n            # Count active servers in this query window\n            response[query_time] = len(pq)\n        \n        # Return results in the correct order\n        return [response[query_time] for query_time in queries]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Priority Queue (pq)**: Maintain a deque representing servers that are active with their last query time in the current window.\n- **Server Last Query Time**: Use a dictionary `server_last_query` to keep track of the most recent query time associated with each server.\n- **Window Expiration**: For each query time, remove servers that have not been queried in the last `x` units of time.\n- **New Server Registration**: Add new servers to the queue if their last query time is within the current window.\n- **Result Calculation**: Finally, count the active servers in the current window for each query time provided.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging Data Structures to ensure accurate analysis and manage server activity. ", "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of servers that didn't receive any requests within each query interval defined by the `queries` array. To do this efficiently, we'll rely on a sliding window technique that involves maintaining a sorted set of server IDs for each query interval and counting the unique server IDs.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort logs by time\n        # Sort queries and find the corresponding index for each queries\n        query_index = list(zip([i for i in range(len(queries))], queries))\n        query_index.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Create a SortedList to efficiently store and count unique server IDs\n        server_id_set = SortedList()\n        count_servers = [0] * len(queries)\n        log_index = 0\n        \n        for q_i, query in query_index:\n            # Remove servers from the SortedList that are outside the current time window\n            while log_index < len(logs) and logs[log_index][1] + x < query:\n                server_id_set.remove(logs[log_index][0])\n                log_index += 1\n            \n            # Add the server to the SortedList for the current time window\n            server_id_set.add(logs[log_index][0])\n            \n            # The number of unique servers in the query window is the count of servers in the SortedList\n            count_servers[q_i] = n - len(server_id_set)\n\n        return count_servers\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting Logs and Queries by Time**: Start by sorting the `logs` based on the `time` since we'll be iterating through them in chronological order. This helps in maintaining the state of server IDs within the current time window.\n\n2. **Sorting Queries**: Sort the `queries` to easily find the relevant indices for each query.\n\n3. **SortedList for Server ID Tracking**: Use a `SortedList` to store server IDs to facilitate unique counting.\n\n4. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the server IDs that are relevant within a window defined by the `queries`. The `SortedList` helps in incrementally updating the unique server IDs, making it efficient.\n\n5. **Counting Servers**: For each query, count the number of servers outside the current time window by subtracting the `SortedList` size from the total number of servers `n`.\n\nThis implementation takes O(n log n + m log m) time, where `n` is the number of logs and `m` is the number of queries, due to the sorting and traversal through logs and queries. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we can break down the process into two main steps:\n1. Sort the list of logs based on time.\n2.

This list is indexed by the time, allowing us to add server arrivals and remove server departures efficiently.\n- **Query Handling**: For each query, we calculate the start and end of the query time interval. We handle removing any servers that started active during the previous interval and then add any servers that were active during the current interval. Finally, we count the number of servers that were active within this interval to determine how many servers did not receive any requests.\n\nThis approach works efficiently by utilizing binary search and sliding window techniques to handle the active server count efficiently.

The `count_within_time_interval` dictionary keeps track of how many requests are happening during each time interval.\n\n3. **Updating the Heap and Count**: As we move the query interval, we adjust the heap and count by adding or removing servers from the heap based on their time.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: For each query, add the number of servers to the result that are not in the heap, which is `n - len(server_heap)`.\n\n5. **Removing Old Requests**: Before moving to the next query, remove servers that no longer fall within the inclusive time interval `[query_end_time - x, query_end_time]`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem of counting servers during time intervals without needing to traverse the logs over and over for each query. ", "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of servers that didn't receive any requests during each time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`, where `x` is a fixed value. Effectively, we need to count the number of unique server IDs that did not have any requests in the last `x` seconds, for each of the given `queries`.\n\nThe goal is to efficiently maintain a count of active servers in time. We can achieve this by using a sliding window approach. Here's how to implement the solution:\n\n1. **Use a HashMap to Count Active Servers in Time**:\n   - We need to maintain a count of how many times each server ID was active in a window of length `x`.\n   - The idea is to iterate through the logs, updating the count of active servers as you go.\n   - As a result, you'll maintain a map where the key is the server ID and the value is how many windows it was active in.\n\n2. **Use a Sliding Window to Process Queries**:\n   - Use a hash set to efficiently count the number of unique IDs active during each time interval defined by a query.\n\n3. **Compute the Result for Each Query**:\n   - For each query, compute the number of new servers that were not active in the time interval, which is simply the set size we have computed minus the number of servers that were active in that time.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by timestamp\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Use a count of active servers\n        active = defaultdict(lambda: 0)\n        # Use a sliding window with a deque for O(1) insertion/deletion\n        from collections import deque\n        window = deque()\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # For each query interval, consider the valid time limit\n            # This is done by shifting the window\n            while window and window[0][1] < query - x:\n                _, server_id = window.popleft()\n                active[server_id] -= 1\n                if active[server_id] == 0:\n                    del active[server_id]\n            \n            # Extend the window to include the new logs\n            for i in range(len(logs)):\n                server_id, timestamp = logs[i]\n                if timestamp > query:\n                    break\n                \n                # Update the active server count\n                active[server_id] += 1\n                window.append([timestamp, server_id])\n                \n            # The number of active servers minus those that have been inactive for the last x time\n            # Removes duplicates\n            result.append(n - len(active))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting and Sliding Window**: \n  - First, sort the `logs` by timestamp to efficiently iterate over them.\n  - Use a sliding window to track active servers in the time interval `[query - x, query]`. \n  - Use a hash map `active` to track how many times each server is active, and a deque `window` to efficiently manage the window.\n\n- **Iterate through Queries**: \n  - For each query, we first \"remove\" `logs` that are outside of the window using a \"shifting\" mechanism in the `window` deque (by removing from the left end). \n  - We then take new logs that are to the right of the query, adding them to the `active` count.\n  - Finally, we calculate the number of servers that weren't active for the last `x` seconds to obtain the result.\n  \nThis solution runs efficiently because each operation is O(1) amortized due to the use of a deque implementation. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we'll use a sliding window approach over the logs.

This will allow us to easily check whether a server received a request within the window [t-x, t] for each query.\n\n2. **Use a Frequency Map to Track Server Activity**: Use a frequency map to keep track of how many times each server has been active within the window. This will allow us to easily compute the number of servers that are active for each query.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Each Query**: Iterate over each query in queries. For each query, determine the range of the window [t-x,t].\n\n4. **Update the Frequency Map**: For each server within this range, increment its count in the frequency map.\n\n5. **Compute the Number of Servers Not Active**: Each time you encounter a server's latest request, its count is decremented by 1. The number of servers with zero count in the frequency map indicate the number of servers that were not active during this time.\n\n6. **Fill the Result Array**: Store the number of servers not active for each query in the result array.\n\n7. **Clean Up**: After each query, move the window by adjusting the end of the window (by incrementing the right pointer) and updating the frequency map.\n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Frequency table to track server activity\n        frequency = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Indices to process queries\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        \n        # Result array\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Expand the window by moving the right pointer\n            while right < len(logs) and logs[right][1] <= query:\n                server_id = logs[right][0]\n                frequency[server_id] += 1\n                right += 1\n            \n            # Shrink the window by moving the left pointer\n            while logs[left][1] < query - x:\n                server_id = logs[left][0]\n                frequency[server_id] -= 1\n                if frequency[server_id] == 0:\n                    del frequency[server_id]\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers not active\n            count = n - len(frequency)\n            result.append(count)\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.countServers(3, [[1, 3], [2, 4], [1, 5]], 2, [5, 4]))\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently processes each query by tracking server activity using a frequency map, ensuring that time complexity is in O(n log n + q log n) where n is the number of logs and q is the number of queries.

The key observation is to focus on the time intervals and not the actual requests themselves.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution using a sliding window approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs and Queries**: We first sort the log and query arrays by time to process them easily.\n\n2. **Set up a Sliding Window**: For each query, adjust the window boundaries such that it contains the time intervals `[query_time - x, query_time]`.\n\n3. **Track Active and Inactive Servers**:\n   - Maintain a count of the number of active servers at any given time, which is incremented for new servers and decremented for expired servers.\n   - Use a `Counter` to keep track of how many servers have been active at any given time.\n\n4. **Count inactive servers**:\n   - For each query, count all the servers in the `Counter` whose count is 0.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort both logs and queries by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        queries.sort()\n        \n        # Counter to keep track of active servers at each time\n        active_servers = Counter()\n        # List to store results for each query\n        result = []\n        \n        # Index for processing logs\n        log_index = 0\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Shrink window to only consider the current query time\n            while log_index < len(logs) and logs[log_index][1] <= query_time - x:\n                # Update active servers counter\n                active_servers[logs[log_index][0]] -= 1\n                log_index += 1\n            \n            # Initialize count to 0 for current query\n            count = 0\n            # Iterate over all servers and count inactive ones\n            for server, count in active_servers.items():\n                if count == 0:\n                    count += 1\n            # Append count to result list\n            result.append(count)\n            \n            # Expand the window by adding a new server\n            if log_index < len(logs) and logs[log_index][1] <= query_time:\n                active_servers[logs[log_index][0]] += 1\n                log_index += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: Sorting helps in efficiently accessing logs and queries by time, which is crucial for processing them in an efficient manner.\n\n- **Counters and Deque**: We use a `Counter` to keep a count of active servers at any given time. This allows us to efficiently determine how many servers are \"inactive\" at any point in time. ", "To solve the problem of determining the number of servers that remain inactive between different queries, we can utilise a prefix sum approach. Here's how we can implement it:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs by Time**: Sort the `logs` array based on time to easily track how many servers are active at a particular time.\n2. **Maintain Active Server Count**: Use a counter to keep track of the number of servers that are active at any given time.\n3. **Calculate Results for Each Query**: For each query `t`, calculate the number of servers that were active before the time `t` and after time (`t - x`).\n4. **Return Results**: For each query, sum the number of servers active up to time `t - x` and subtract those active up to time `t`. This gives us the answer to the query.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize active_servers as a sorted list\n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        # Initialize a counter for number of servers\n        count = 0\n        result = []\n        \n        # Iterate over each query\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Calculate the starting point of window (time minus x)\n            window_start = query_time - x\n            \n            # Find the index of the first log entry after window_start\n            start_index = SortedList.bisect_right(active_servers, window_start)\n            \n            # Remove server IDs that are no longer in the window\n            while active_servers and active_servers[0] < query_time:\n                active_servers.pop(0)\n                count -= 1\n            \n            # Calculate number of servers active at this point\n            inactive_count = len(active_servers) - start_index\n            \n            # Add the result to the list\n            result.append(count - inactive_count)\n            \n            # Add the current server to the list of active servers\n            active_servers.add(logs[start_index][1])\n            count += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: Sorting helps in quickly find the occurrence of active servers, which is crucial for answering queries.\n- **SortedList**: A sorted list allows us to compute intervals easily. It efficiently takes care of the log-finding burden.\n- **Window Management**: We maintain an active server list that is sorted by the time they were last active. We calculate and subtract from this list to determine how many servers are active for each query.\n- **Counting inactive servers**: When moving a query forward, we track the number of servers that are active before the current query. We subtract from this approach to count the number of servers that are inactive.\n\nThis solution efficiently manages time intervals by leveraging a sorted list, and therefore ensures the solution runs in O(mlogm) time, where m is the number of log entries, which is optimal for this problem. ", "To solve the problem of finding the number of servers that did not receive any requests within a time interval, we can utilize a sliding window approach combined with a set container to keep track of the servers that have received a request during the window.

This ensures that we process requests in order of their occurrence.\n\n2. **Two Pointers**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer keeps track of the start of the current interval, and the `right` pointer expands the window until it reaches `query_time` or the end of the `logs`.\n\n3. **Active Server Set**: We use a set `active_servers` to keep track of the servers that have received requests during the current window.\n\n4. **Server Count Dictionary**: We use a dictionary `server_count` to count the occurrences of each server. The `active_servers` set helps in quickly determining which servers are active and which are not, ensuring that we only count servers that have received a request at least once during this time interval.\n\n5. **Calculate Answer**: For each query time, we count the number of active servers as the difference between the number of active servers at the start of the window and the number of servers that have received at least one request. The condition to find these servers is checking if the count of that server in `server_count` is greater than zero; indicating it has received requests at least once within the current window.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the requests and computes the answer for each query in linear time complexity by leveraging the sorted logs and a set to maintain the active servers.

This helps in efficiently getting to the correct window of time for each query.\n\n2. **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers: `left` and `right`. Move the `right` pointer forward and add new log entries to the current window. Also, increment the count of unique servers active in the window.\n\n3. **Contraction**: As the `right` pointer advances, it might be necessary to shrink the window of the `left` pointer to include only relevant logs. This is achieved by moving the `left` pointer forward and removing log entries from the window. Also, decrease the count of servers left since they have been removed from the window.\n\n4. **Result Computation**: After expanding and contracting, the `count` variable represents the number of unique servers that are active in the current window. Subtract this from `n` (total number of servers) to get the answer.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the number of servers that did not have requests within the last `x` seconds for each query, efficiently handling the large number of log entries and queries. ", "\nThis problem involves using a sliding window technique to calculate the count of servers that did not receive any requests within a certain time interval, given logs of server requests and queries about those time intervals. \n\nThe idea is to maintain a count of the servers that are online at each time point and periodically count the number of servers that are online at the start of each desired query interval. \n\nThe sliding window approach will allow us to efficiently manage the intervals by only considering the latest `x` time units. This is because we will use a hash map or counter to determine which servers are online within those `x` time units.\n\nHere is the complete Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a deque for server requests\n        server_req_time: Dict[int, deque] = {i: deque() for i in range(1, n + 1)}\n        \n        # Initialize a SortedList to efficiently count servers online\n        online_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        # Initialize a list to hold the results for each query\n        results = []\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Remove server requests older than the current query\n            for server_id in range(1, n + 1):\n                while server_req_time[server_id] and server_req_time[server_id][0] + x <= query_time:\n                    online_servers.remove(server_req_time[server_id].popleft())\n            \n            # Add the current server request to the deque\n            server_id = logs[0][0]\n            server_req_time[server_id].append(logs[0][1])\n            \n            # Update the online_servers list\n            if server_req_time[server_id]:\n                online_servers.add(server_req_time[server_id][-1])\n            \n            # Calculate the count of servers that are online\n            results.append(n - len(online_servers))\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting Logs:**\n   - The logs are sorted by time to make it easier to manage server requests.\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - We use a dictionary `server_req_time` to store the most recent time each server received a request.\n   - We use a `SortedList` `online_servers` to keep track of the most recent request times for servers in the current window of size `x`.\n\n3. **Processing Queries:**\n   - For each query, we:\n     - Remove server requests that are older than the current query time `query_time - x`.\n     - Add the latest request time from the server corresponding to the first log to the `online_servers`.\n     - Calculate the number of servers online and append it to the results list.\n\n4. **Time Complexity:**\n   - The `logs` and `queries` lists each have up to `10^5` elements.\n   - The time is indexed by `x`.\n   - This algorithm runs in O(n log n) time due to sorting and the Python `SortedList`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the desired results using a combination of sorting, deque and a sorted set. ", "\n**Understanding the Problem**  \n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a given time interval for each query, we can break the problem into smaller subtasks:\n\n1. Preprocess the logs to get a list of server IDs and their time stamps.\n2. Process each query individually.\n\n**Key Approach**  \n\n- We need to maintain a sliding window over the logs to count the number of servers that did not receive any requests under the given time interval.\n\n- For each query, we'll calculate how many servers were active during the query time interval minus `x`.\n\nHere's the complete solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Use a deque to maintain the servers in the current sliding window\n        active_servers = collections.deque()\n        # Keep a counter of the number of times each server was active\n        server_counts = collections.Counter()\n        \n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove servers that are out of the current window (time <= query - x)\n            while active_servers and active_servers[0][1] <= query - x:\n                old_server = active_servers.popleft()\n                if server_counts[old_server[0]] == 1:\n                    del server_counts[old_server[0]]\n                else:\n                    server_counts[old_server[0]] -= 1\n            \n            # Add servers that are within the current window (time >= query - x)\n            while logs and logs[0][1] < query:\n                new_server, new_time = logs.pop(0)\n                active_servers.append((new_server, new_time))\n                server_counts[new_server] += 1\n            \n            # Result for the current query is: total servers - number of servers that are active\n            result.append(n - len(server_counts))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n**Explanation**  \n\n1. **Sort Logs**: Since query times are provided in the `queries` array, we sort the logs to process them by time.\n2. **Deque and Counter**: We maintain a deque to easily manage the servers in the current window, and a counter to count the number of times each server appears in the current window.\n3. **Main Loop**: For each query, we handle active servers outside of the window by popping from the front and adjusting the count in the counter. We then add servers that are within the window by popping from the start of the logs.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer for a query is the total number of servers minus the number of servers that were active in the current window.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles each query within a time complexity of O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of logs and m is the number of queries, making it suitable for large input sizes. ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting how many servers didn't receive requests during a time interval, we can utilize the idea of sliding windows to efficiently process each query. The key is to sort the logs by time, and use a data structure (such as a set or a deque) to only consider the latest servers seen within the window. This strategy ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently with respect to query times.\n\nHere's the complete code implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a deque to efficiently track the last seen servers\n        seen_servers = collections.deque()\n        \n        # Initialize a counter to keep track of server activity\n        server_activity = [0] * n\n        \n        # Process each query\n        results = []\n        for query in queries:\n            # Shift the deque to include only servers seen in the current window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] < query - x:\n                server = logs.pop(0)[0]\n                if server_activity[server] == 1:\n                    seen_servers.popleft()\n                server_activity[server] = 0\n            \n            # Add the server activity count for the servers that were seen\n            count = sum(server_activity)\n            \n            # Add the current server to the deque and count\n            server = logs[0][0]\n            if server_activity[server] == 0:\n                seen_servers.append(server)\n                count += 1\n            server_activity[server] += 1\n            \n            # Add the result for the current query\n            results.append(n - count)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs by Time**: First, sort the `logs` by the time values. This allows us easily determine the servers that did not receive requests during a particular time window.\n\n2. **Use a Deque**: A deque (double-ended queue) is used to keep track of the servers that appeared in the current window. This helps to efficiently remove servers that left after being added to the window.\n\n3. **Count Active Servers**: Use an array `server_activity` to keep track of how many times each server has been seen. Only consider servers if they have been seen once.\n\n4. **Process Each Query**: \n   - Process each query in the order and manage the deque's state to consider only servers that have been seen within the current time window.\n   - Update the count of servers that have been seen in the current window, and add them to the result list.\n\nThe total time complexity of this solution is O(N log N + Q log Q + N + Q), which is efficient for this problem given the constraints. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of servers that did not receive any requests for each query. We can achieve this efficiently using a deque (or a sliding window technique) to track the time windows and a counter to count the number of servers that were not active during each time window.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time to process them in order\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Use a deque to maintain a sliding window of size x\n        active_servers = deque()\n        \n        # A counter to keep track of the number of active servers at each time\n        counter = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Process each log\n        for server_id, time in logs:\n            # Remove elements from the beginning of the queue that are no longer active\n            while active_servers and time - active_servers[0] >= x:\n                left_server = active_servers.popleft()\n                counter[left_server] -= 1\n            \n            # Add the new server to the queue\n            active_servers.append(time)\n            counter[server_id] += 1\n        \n        result = []\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Count the number of servers that are not active at this query time\n            while active_servers and query_time - active_servers[0] >= x:\n                left_server = active_servers.popleft()\n                counter[left_server] -= 1\n            \n            total_active = sum(count > 0 for count in counter.values())\n            result.append(n - total_active)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting Logs**: First, we sort the `logs` list by their second column (the `time`). This allows us to process the log records in order, so we don't miss any active time windows and correctly compute accurate counts.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a `deque` to maintain a sliding window of size `x`. Each time we process a log, we compare the current time to the first element in the deque. We remove elements from the deque that have been inactive for `x` or more time units.\n\n3. **Server Counting**: We maintain a counter to count the number of servers that are currently active. We add servers to the counter and remove servers from the counter when they leave the window.\n\n4. **Query Processing**: For each query, we adjust the sliding window by removing any servers that were recorded as inactive at the time of this query. The remaining unique servers in the counter represent those that are not active.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines the number of servers not active for each query using a combination of sorting and a sliding window. ", "To solve the problem of calculating the number of servers that did not receive requests during a given time range, we can break it down into two steps:\n\n1. Sort the log entries by time for efficient use with O(nlgn) sorting time complexity.\n2. For each query, calculate the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`. Here, we use a sliding window approach with a dictionary to track the number of server requests within the current window.\n\nHere's the complete Python code that achieves the described solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a dictionary to count server requests by ID\n        server_requests = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Sliding window indices, left and right endpoints\n        left, right = 0, 0\n\n        # Initialize an array to store the counts for each query\n        result = []\n\n        # Process each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Shrink the window if it goes out of the query's range\n            while logs[right][1] <= query - x:\n                server_id = logs[right][0]\n                server_requests[server_id] -= 1\n                if server_requests[server_id] == 0:\n                    del server_requests[server_id]\n                right += 1\n\n            # Add the servers not seen in the current window\n            result.append(n - len(server_requests))\n            \n            # Expand the window\n            server_id = logs[right][0]\n            server_requests[server_id] += 1\n            right += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: First, we sort the `logs` array by time. This allows us to iterate through the sorted data efficiently using the sliding window technique.\n\n- **Dictionary Tracking**: We use a dictionary, `server_requests`, to count the number of requests received by each server.\n\n- **Sliding Window**: We maintain a window `[left, right]` that initially covers the time range `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`. This approach ensures the right boundary of the window remains within each query's time range. The left boundary is adjusted based on the current position in the logs while ensuring each server is only counted once within the window (in other words, servers which were requesting more than once are counted just once in the window).\n\n- **Result Accumulation**: In each iteration, we compute the number of servers that did not receive any request within the current window, which is then stored in the `result` list for each query.\n\nBy using these steps, we efficiently compute the required information for each query using a sliding window technique, all with O(n + m log n) time complexity, where `n` is the number of logs and `m` is the number of queries. ", "\nThis problem is related to tracking the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a time interval. Here's a detailed solution using a data structure to efficiently handle the queries:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: Start by sorting the `logs` array based on the time since we need to find the servers which were active during a time interval.\n\n2. **Use a Priority Queue (`MinHeap`)**: We'll use a priority queue to efficiently handle the servers which have been active the longest. We'll remove servers from the queue when they exceed the queried time interval (`[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`).\n\n3. **`Counter` to count inactive servers**: We'll use a counter to keep track of how many servers were active during this time.\n\n4. **Maintain Active Server Counts**: For each query, we'll prepare the interval of interest and adjust for the counter by processing elements in the logs. This will ensure the correct count of inactive servers at each query time. \n\nHere's the implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort logs by time\n        \n        result = []\n        for i, query_time in enumerate(queries):\n            active_servers = Counter()  # Counter to track active servers at the current query time\n            min_heap = []  # Min heap to prioritize least active servers\n            \n            # Find servers which have been active before the query\n            prev_query_time = query_time - x\n            idx = 0\n            while idx < len(logs) and logs[idx][1] <= prev_query_time:\n                heappush(min_heap, logs[idx][0])\n                active_servers[logs[idx][0]] += 1\n                idx += 1\n            \n            while idx < len(logs) and logs[idx][1] <= query_time:\n                server = logs[idx][0]\n                active_servers[server] += 1\n                heappush(min_heap, server)\n                \n                # Remove servers exceeding query time\n                while min_heap and min_heap[0] < prev_query_time:\n                    removed_server = heappop(min_heap)\n                    if active_servers[removed_server] > 0:\n                        active_servers[removed_server] -= 1\n                        if active_servers[removed_server] == 0:\n                            del active_servers[removed_server]\n                \n                # Compute the number of servers which meet the condition\n                result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n                idx += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: The logs are sorted by time. This simplifies finding the servers active before the current query time.\n- **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: We maintain a min-heap to quickly identify the servers which have been active over a time window. This helps in removing the oldest servers before the new ones are added.\n- **Counter**: We use a `Counter` to efficiently count how many servers are active at each query.\n- **Iteration**: For each query, we process the logs and update the active servers counter. This helps in determining how many servers are still active.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem using a combination of sorting and priority queues, making it suitable for the given constraints. ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specified time interval, we can utilize a sliding window approach. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Sort `logs` by time.\n2. Use a count frequency array to record the number of requests each server has received.\n3. Use a sliding window to maintain the number of servers that have received requests within the time interval `[t_i - x, t_i]`.\n4. Iterate through each time query in `queries` and compute the number of servers that have zero requests in the current sliding window.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize the count frequency array\n        freq = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Use a sorted list to efficiently manage the time windows\n        sorted_times = SortedList()\n        \n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = []\n        \n        # Initialize the sliding window\n        start, end = 0, 0\n        \n        for time in queries:\n            # Determine the start of the interval\n            start_interval = time - x\n            \n            # Advance the end pointer until it overlaps with the current query\n            while end < len(logs) and logs[end][1] <= time:\n                # Update the frequency of received requests\n                server_id = logs[end][0]\n                freq[server_id] += 1\n                \n                # Maintain a sorted list to track when servers are idle\n                sorted_times.add(logs[end][1])\n                \n                # Move the end of the window\n                end += 1\n            \n            # Remove any servers that are no longer in the window\n            while sorted_times and sorted_times[0] < start_interval:\n                # Remove the first server that has not been active for x amount of time\n                # This means it is no longer in the interval [t_i - x, t_i]\n                server_id = logs[sorted_times.index(sorted_times[0])][0]\n                freq[server_id] -= 1\n                sorted_times.pop(0)\n            \n            # Count the number of servers with zero requests\n            idle_servers = sum(1 if freq[i] == 0 else 0 for i in range(1, n + 1))\n            result.append(idle_servers)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Log Sorting**: We sort `logs` by time. This is necessary because we need to maintain a sliding window section of the logs ordered by time.\n- **Frequency Array**: We use a frequency array to keep track of the count of requests received for each server.\n- **SortedList**: We use a `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` library to efficiently manage the time stamps of servers that are idle. This allows us to quickly compute the number of servers that are idle within the current time window.\n- **Window Maintenance**: For each query `t_i`, we compute the start of the time window `t_i - x`, and maintain a count of servers that have no activity within this window.\n- **Result Computation**: Finally, we compute the number of servers that have no activity during the current time step by checking the frequency array.\n\nThis solution efficiently manages the time complexity of the problem by leveraging sorting and efficient data structures, enabling us to handle the large data sizes expected in competitive programming. ", "\n#### Explanation:\n- The key idea here is to efficiently count how many servers did not receive any requests for any given query time. We can do this by maintaining a heap to keep track of the latest server requests in the past `x` minutes.\n\n### Algoritm\n1. **Sort Logs by Time**: Start by sorting the `logs` based on the time. This will help us process the logs efficiently in a sequential manner as we process each query.\n\n2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The priority queue will store the server ids in decreasing order of their latest requests. This will allow us to efficiently track the servers with most recent requests.\n\n3. **Processing Queries**:\n   - Initialize a priority queue with the first `x` logs. This will be the first `x` servers with their most recent request.\n   - Iterate over each query `q` and consider the servers that become inactive due to not receiving any requests in the last `x` minutes:\n     - Remove servers that have been inactive for longer than `q - x` from the priority queue.\n     - Add the server `s` at `q` back into the priority queue.\n     - The number of servers in the queue at each time point `q` will represent how many servers are considered inactive.\n\n### Final Code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\nfrom heapq import *\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # use a defaultdict to manage map from server ids to their last request timestamps\n        server_last_request = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # initialize a (min-heap) priority queue to store server ids with most recent request\n        active_servers = []\n        \n        # index of the next server log to process\n        log_idx = 0\n        \n        # initialize result array\n        result = []\n        \n        # iterate over queries\n        for q in queries:\n            # remove any servers that haven't been used in the past `x` minutes\n            while active_servers and q - x > active_servers[0][0]:\n                _, sid = heappop(active_servers)\n                server_last_request[sid] = 0\n            \n            # add the server at this time to the queue\n            while log_idx < len(logs) and logs[log_idx][1] <= q:\n                sid, time = logs[log_idx]\n                heappush(active_servers, (time, sid))\n                server_last_request[sid] = time\n                log_idx += 1\n            \n            # active servers minus those that have been inactive for more than x\n            result.append(len(active_servers) - sum(timestamp == 0 for timestamp in server_last_request.values()))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\n- The main time complexity is from sorting `logs`, which is `O(n log n)` based on the sort criteria (sorting by time).\n- Sorting the logs ensures that we can easily process them sequentially as we iterate over each query.\n- Removing inactive servers from the heap is `O(1)` on average using heap operations.\n\nThis ensures an efficient processing and counts the servers without the complexity of iterating over logs multiple times. ", "\nHere's the complete solution to the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a given time interval:\n\n1. **Index Time Events**:\n   - Since the queries input is an array of times, we can use it to index time events that will be useful for us.\n   - We want to know how many servers have not received requests in the interval [time - x, time], for each query time.\n\n2. **Server Frequency Count**:\n   - We need a convenient way to track the number of requests a server has received.\n   - A Counter from collections module will be useful here since it allows for efficient count updates.\n\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - We'll use a sliding window approach to process the time intervals.\n   - For each query time `q`, we'll count how many unique requests have been received in the time interval [`q - x`, `q`].\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - For each query time `q`, the total number of servers that have received requests up to `q` minus requests up to `q - x` will give us the number of servers that did not receive any requests during this interval.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a sliding window approach to maintain the number of unique request counts within each [`q - x`, `q`] time interval.\n   - For each query time `q`, we will consider all requests ending at this `q`, prune those that are outside the current interval and update our counter accordingly.\n\n6. **Code Implementation**:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs based on time to process them by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda t: t[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a frequency counter for requests\n        requests_count = Counter()\n        # A set to track unique requests\n        unique_requests = set()\n        # A variable to track the number of servers that have received requests in the interval\n        requests_count_in_query = 0\n        \n        current_time = 0\n        result = []\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for t in queries:\n            # Process all log events ending at this time\n            while current_time < len(logs) and logs[current_time][1] <= t:\n                server_id = logs[current_time][0]\n                \n                # Increment the requests count for the current server\n                requests_count[server_id] += 1\n                \n                # If it's the first request, add it to the unique set\n                if requests_count[server_id] == 1:\n                    unique_requests.add(server_id)\n                \n                current_time += 1\n            \n            # Decrement the counts for servers that are outside the current time window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] <= t - x:\n                server_id = logs[0][0]\n                requests_count[server_id] -= 1\n                \n                # If no more requests from that server, remove it from the unique set\n                if requests_count[server_id] == 0:\n                    unique_requests.remove(server_id)\n                \n                logs.pop(0)\n            \n            # The count of servers that did not receive any requests is n - |unique_requests|\n            result.append(n - len(unique_requests))\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.countServers(n, logs, x, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: We first sort the logs by time to efficiently handle the request processing.\n- **Counter**: The Counter dictionary ensures efficient tracking of how many requests each server has received.\n- **Window Processing**: For each query time, we advance the log pointer forward until there are no more entries that end before the query time. This accounts for incoming requests.\n- **Sliding Window**: We then consider the log entries that started before `t - x`, as these are outside the current query's window. We update the unique requests counter and the Counter dictionary.\n- **Result Calculation**: For each query, we compute the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the latest interval (`[t - x, t]`), which is `n - |unique_requests|`.\n\nThis efficient solution efficiently processes the problem by leveraging the sorting, Counter, and sliding window properties. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of servers that did not receive any requests within the last `x` seconds for each query. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs by Time**: This will help us identify servers that did not receive any requests during the interval [t-x, t] where t is the current query time.\n2. **Use a Sliding Window Technique**: We'll maintain a queue of servers receiving the most recent requests for the last `x` seconds.\n3. **Process Queries**: For each query, count the number of servers in the current window that have not received requests up to the current time (t).\n4. **Return the Results**: For each query, compute the count of servers not receiving any requests and return it in the array `arr`.\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # List to keep track of servers sorted by most recent access time\n        most_recent_access_times = [0] * n\n\n        # Deque for servers that did not receive any requests in the last x seconds\n        no_requests_in_x_seconds = deque()\n        \n        # Array to store the result for each query\n        result = []\n\n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove servers that have been in the deque for more than x seconds\n            while no_requests_in_x_seconds and query - no_requests_in_x_seconds[0][0] > x:\n                server_id, _ = no_requests_in_x_seconds.popleft()\n                most_recent_access_times[server_id] = -1  # Mark as unused\n\n            # Add the current query time to all servers that are not in the deque\n            # because it's their earliest possible access time\n            i = 0\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query - x:\n                # Add this server to the current window if it's not in the deque\n                # and it's not marked as unused\n                if (most_recent_access_times[logs[i][0] - 1] <= query - x\n                    and logs[i][1] <= query - x):\n                    no_requests_in_x_seconds.append((logs[i][1], logs[i][0] - 1))\n                    most_recent_access_times[logs[i][0] - 1] = logs[i][1]\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Count servers that are not accessed by any request in the window\n            count = n - len(no_requests_in_x_seconds)\n            result.append(count)\n\n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting Logs**: Sort the logs by time. This helps us easily identify the server's last request time.\n\n- **Sliding Window**: \n  - Use a deque `no_requests_in_x_seconds` to keep track of servers that did not receive any requests in the last `x` seconds. \n  - Maintain a list `most_recent_access_times` to store the most recent access time of each server. \n\n- **Updating the Window**: \n  - For each query, remove servers from the window that have been idle for more than `x` seconds and mark these servers as unused. \n  - Then, add servers that have not received any requests into the window since the current query time if they are not marked as unused by the most recent access time.\n\n- **Counting Servers**: \n  - When a query is done, the number of servers in the `no_requests_in_x_seconds` deque represent the number of servers that did not receive any requests within the last `x` seconds. Hence, the difference between the total servers (`n`) and the length of the deque is the number of servers not receiving requests for the current query. \n\nThis method ensures that each query is processed efficiently with a guaranteed time complexity in `O(n log n + m log m + q log n)`, where `n` is the number of servers, `m` is the number of logs, and `q` is the number of queries. This is efficient due to the use of sorting, sliding windows, and binary search. ", "To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a sliding window technique with a timeline to track the number of requests received during each query time interval. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: We sort the `logs` array by time. This is important because we'll use a sliding window to determine the number of requests handled within a specific time interval.\n\n2. **Use a Double-Ended Queue (deque) to Track Active Server IDs**: This data structure allows us to efficiently track the servers with activity within each sliding window. Every time a server requests arrives, we add it to the deque, and every time a request's expiration exceeds the current window, we remove it from the deque.\n\n3. **Iterate through the Queries**: For each query in the `queries` array, we determine the required window and count the active servers within that window.\n\n4. **Track Total Active Servers in the Deque**: As we forward the query to the next time, we keep track of the total active servers by considering the size of the deque.\n\nHere is the implementation of this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs based on the time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a deque to hold server IDs\n        active_servers = deque()\n        # A counter array to track active servers at each timestamp\n        count_at_time = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the number of active servers at each time\n        for server_id, timestamp in logs:\n            # Adjust the count of active servers by adding the new entry\n            count_at_time[server_id] += 1\n            if count_at_time[server_id] > 1:\n                # If it's the second request for this server, remove it from the deque\n                active_servers.remove(server_id)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, add it to the deque\n                active_servers.append(server_id)\n            \n            # Ensure that the active_servers deque has at most n elements, removing old timestamps\n            if len(active_servers) > n:\n                # Remove the first server ID from the deque\n                last_server_id = active_servers.popleft()\n                # Update the count for this server ID\n                count_at_time[last_server_id] -= 1\n\n        # Calculate the number of servers at each query\n        answer = []\n        for query in queries:\n            # Calculate the period for the current query\n            start_time = query - x\n            # Count servers that handled requests up to this point\n            num_active_servers = sum(count_at_time[1:])\n            # Handle servers that might not have the full period (from start_time to query)\n            for server_id, count_at_t in enumerate(count_at_time[1:], start=1):\n                if count_at_t == 0:\n                    continue\n                if logs[0][1] <= start_time:\n                    if logs[0][1] + x <= query:\n                        num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n                if logs[-1][1] <= start_time:\n                    if logs[-1][1] + x <= query:\n                        num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n                if start_time <= logs[0][1] and logs[-1][1] <= query:\n                    num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n            answer.append(num_active_servers)\n        \n        return answer\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the queries by using a sliding window and a deque to keep track of active servers while maintaining efficiency. Since the input data is sorted, we can use this to find the required active server count in each query in O(n + m log n + q log n) time complexity (where n is the number of servers and m is the number of requests, and q is the number of queries), making it suitable for high performance on large server sets.\n\n", "To solve this problem, we need to manage the frequency of server usage in queries of `x` time units before a query time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Initialize a Counter**: We will use a counter `count` to track how many times each server has been seen within the last `x` time units.\n\n2. **Sort the Logs**: We sort the logs based on their time stamps, since we'll be iterating through the logs and removing servers from the count as soon as they are no longer within the time frame we're interested in.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Logic**: We'll use a sliding window to count the frequency of servers that have been seen in the last `x` units of time.\n\n4. **Maintain a Set**: We will maintain a set `servers_in_time` to track the servers that have been seen within our current window.\n\n5. **Iterate through Queries**: For each query time, we adjust our counter by removing servers that were seen more than `x` time units ago. We then count the number of remaining servers in `servers_in_time`.\n\nLet's implement this in the given Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n\n        # Use a counter to count the frequency of each server's use\n        count = Counter()\n        # Use a set to track which servers have been seen in the last x units of time\n        servers_in_time = set()\n        # Current time of the first server to be evaluated in the last x units of time\n        left = 0\n        # Number of servers that are on during the last 1000 units of time\n        ans = []\n\n        # Loop through each query\n        for q in queries:\n            # Extend the time window\n            while left < len(logs) and logs[left][1] < q - x:\n                # If the server's last use is more than `x` units ago,\n                # remove it from the count\n                count[logs[left][0]] -= 1\n                if count[logs[left][0]] == 0:\n                    servers_in_time.remove(logs[left][0])\n                left += 1\n\n            # Add the current server to the count\n            count[logs[left][0]] += 1\n            servers_in_time.add(logs[left][0])\n\n            # Add the number of servers that are still active\n            ans.append(n - len(servers_in_time))\n\n        return ans\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# result = solution.countServers(6, [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]], 2, [2, 3, 4, 5])\n# print(result)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting the Logs**: Since we need to count a server's activity within the past `x` units of time, sorting helps us efficiently update our counts.\n  \n- **Sliding Window**: We maintain a window over the last `x` units of each query's time by adjusting our `left` pointer to always be the first request that is not inside the window.\n  \n- **Counter and Set**: We use a counter to keep track of the frequency of each server's usage and a set to determine which servers are actually counted.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the sorted logs and sliding window technique, ensuring each iteration of a query takes constant time. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we can use a technique called sliding window and a data structure that keeps track of the time ranges efficiently. We will iterate over the `queries` and for each query, compute the number of servers that did not receive requests during the last `x` seconds from the query time.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Use a Dictionary to Count Frequencies**: To quickly determine how many times each server ID appears in the logs, we will use a dictionary.\n\n2. **Sort the Logs**: Sort the logs by time, as we only need to consider requests up to `queries[i]`, and we assume that `queries` is sorted in ascending order.\n\n3. **Use a Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window to efficiently manage the requests that possibly fall within the current query.\n\n4. **Use a HashMap to Count Active Servers**: We'll maintain a hashmap to keep track of the server IDs whose requests are currently active, and use this to determine how many servers have not received any requests within the last `x` seconds.\n\n5. **Update the HashMap as Time Elapses**: As we move through the sorted log entries, adjust the active server count by updating the hashmap based on the current query time.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort logs by time\n        \n        # Count the frequency of each server ID\n        server_count = defaultdict(int)\n        for server_id, _ in logs:\n            server_count[server_id] += 1\n\n        # Sort the queries\n        sorted_queries = sorted(enumerate(queries), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # To store results for each query\n        result = [0] * len(queries)\n\n        # Use a dictionary to manage active servers\n        active_servers = defaultdict(int)\n        left = 0\n\n        for idx, query_time in sorted_queries:\n            # Shrink the window by moving left pointer\n            while logs[left][1] < query_time - x:\n                server_id = logs[left][0]\n                active_servers[server_id] -= 1\n                if active_servers[server_id] == 0:\n                    del active_servers[server_id]\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Consider only servers with number of requests less than x\n            for server_id, count in server_count.items():\n                if count >= x:\n                    if active_servers[server_id] == 0:\n                        result[idx] += 1\n                else:\n                    if server_id not in active_servers:\n                        result[idx] += 1\n            \n            # Expand window by adding each server in range\n            for j in range(left, len(logs)):\n                server_id = logs[j][0]\n                if server_id not in active_servers:\n                    active_servers[server_id] = 0\n                active_servers[server_id] += 1\n                if active_servers[server_id] >= x:\n                    break  # No need to consider further\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the logs enables us to efficiently find the earliest request time that's out of the range for the current query.\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: By maintaining a window that starts at the beginning of the logs and extends to just before the current query, we effectively discard all requests that are not relevant.\n- **Server Count Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to quickly identify servers that have requests whose frequency is at least `x`.\n- **HashMap for Active Servers**: Maintain a hashmap to keep track of the current active servers for each query time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle all the queries efficiently, while minimizing the number of operations on the log data.

", "\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Sort Logs by Time**: The `logs` array is sorted by time.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each query, use the sliding window technique to determine the servers that are inactive during the time window `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`.\n\n3. **Two-Pointer Approach**: Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the current bounds of the window.\n\n4. **Active Servers Set**: At each timestamp, maintain a set to keep track of the servers currently active.\n\n5. **Result Array Computation**: For each query, calculate the number of servers currently active (stored in the set) and update the result array `arr`.\n\nThe overall idea is to efficiently process the large amount of data with the sliding window approach and a set of currently active servers.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a sorted list to store server IDs\n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        # Initialize the result array to store the answer\n        arr = []\n        \n        # Pointers for the sliding window\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Expand the window\n            while right < len(logs) and logs[right][1] <= query:\n                server_id = logs[right][0]\n                right += 1\n                # Add server_id to the set of active servers\n                active_servers.add(server_id)\n            \n            # Shrink the window\n            while logs[left][1] < query - x:\n                # Remove the server at left from the set of active servers\n                active_servers.remove(logs[left][0])\n                left += 1\n            \n            # The number of servers that are active at the current timestamp\n            active_count = len(active_servers)\n            arr.append(active_count)  # Append the result for this query\n        \n        return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: We sort the `logs` list first based on the timestamps. This makes it easier to calculate the number of servers active at any given timestamp.\n\n- **SortedList**: We use a sorted list (`SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` library) to efficiently keep track of the active servers as we process each timestamp.\n\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers to efficiently control the window of interest.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem and is well-suited for large data sets due to the use of sorted lists and a two-pointer technique. ", "\nThis problem requires answering the number of servers that did not receive any requests for a given time interval. The key observation is that for each query, we only need to track the number of servers that did not receive requests during the last `x` seconds before the current query.\n\nHere's how you can solve the problem:\n\n1. **Sort Logs by Time**: The first step is to sort the `logs` with respect to time. This will help us efficiently track the number of servers that received requests.\n\n2. **Use a Monotonic Queue to Track Recently Active Servers**: Use a deque to maintain a list of servers that were active during the last `x` seconds. This deque should be kept sorted to quickly remove servers that have become inactive during the current interval.\n\n3. **Iterate over Queries**: For each query, update the deque and count servers that have not been active (i.e., no requests in the current interval).\n\n4. **Count Servers**: For each server in the deque, compute the earliest time it can be considered inactive and check if it should still be considered active for the current query.\n\nHere is the complete code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Build monotonically increasing deque\n        dq = deque()\n        \n        # Array to track answer for queries\n        ans = [0] * len(queries)\n        \n        # Index to track current log\n        i = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over queries\n        for j, query in enumerate(queries):\n            # Remove servers that have been inactive for more than x seconds\n            while dq and logs[dq[0]][1] + x <= query:\n                dq.popleft()\n            \n            # Add new servers to the deque\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query:\n                dq.append(i)\n                i += 1\n            \n            # Decrement the number of servers\n            servers_left = len(dq)\n            while dq and logs[dq[0]][1] + x <= query:\n                dq.popleft()\n                servers_left -= 1\n            \n            # Add the number of servers that did not receive requests\n            ans[j] = n - servers_left\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Log Sorting**: We sort the logs by time, which helps efficiently iterate over the logs and identify when a server becomes inactive.\n  \n- **Deque**: We use a deque to maintain the list of active servers. We maintain the deque sorted to allow for easy removal of inactive servers.\n\n- **Computing Active Servers**: For each query, we remove inactive servers from the deque and check how many servers are left.\n\nThis solution efficiently tracks the number of servers that didn't receive requests in a given time interval by leveraging a deque and sorted logs. ", "\nThis problem involves finding out how many servers did not receive requests within a specific time interval for each query.

This helps in efficiently tracking the active servers in our sliding window.\n  \n- **Sliding window**: We maintain a set of active servers, which updates as we move our sliding window through the logs.\n\n- **Counting active servers**: For each query, we calculate the number of servers that are active during the interval [query-x, query].\n\nThis approach works in O(n log n + q log n) time, where `n` is the number of requests and `q` is the number of queries. The sorting and binary search operations are approximatly O(n log n), and each query performs O(log n) operations, each potentially updating the sliding window. ", "To solve this problem, we need to track the number of servers that did not receive any requests in each time interval. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:\n\n1. **Sort Logs by Time**: First, sort `logs` by the `time` value in ascending order. This helps us efficiently calculate the number of servers that did not receive any requests in the specified intervals.\n\n2. **Use a Sliding Window to Count Requests**: We maintain a set/counter for the servers that have been active during this time interval. Here's how this works:\n   - We use a sliding window of size `x` units to calculate the activity of each server.\n   - For each query, calculate the number of servers that weren't active in the time interval from the current query time minus `x` to the current query time.\n\n3. **Use a Deque to Maintain Active Server Information**:\n   - Use a deque to store the server IDs.\n   - Initially, pop the first element from the deque until the sliding window condition is met (if the first element is out of the interval).\n   - Add each incoming server ID to the deque, and remove the oldest server ID if its time is out of the current interval (i.e., back > query time - x).\n   - The size of the deque (i.e., the number of elements) gives the count of active servers at the current time.\n\n4. **Maintain and Calculate Result**:\n   - For each query, calculate the number of servers that weren't active in the sliding window and store it.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the list of counts corresponding to each query.\n\nHere is the implemented and optimized code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize result array\n        result = []\n        \n        # Deque to track servers and their activity\n        active_servers = deque()\n        \n        # Initialize index for logs and queries\n        i = 0\n        \n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Shift the window of time\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query_time - x:\n                # Remove servers that have left the window\n                server_id = logs[i][0]\n                while active_servers and active_servers[0][1] <= query_time - x:\n                    active_servers.popleft()\n                i += 1\n            \n            # Add new servers to the list\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query_time:\n                active_servers.append(logs[i])\n                i += 1\n            \n            # The size of the active_servers deque is the count of servers not active\n            result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of Key Points:\n- **Sorting Logs**: Sorting by time helps us efficiently process each query and locate servers in the current window.\n- **Deque for Active Servers**: Use a deque to efficiently manage the active servers. We store server IDs with their associated query time in the deque.\n- **Using Pointers for Queries and Logs**: Use two pointers, one for logs and another for queries, to efficiently determine the active servers.

Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n1. **Log Processing:** Sort the logs by time, and use a deque to manage the active query times. This will allow us to efficiently determine which queries have not been answered in the specified time window.\n\n2. **Sliding Window:** For each query time, calculate how many active servers were there at the time of the query.\n\n3. **Counting Active Servers:** Maintain a count of each server and its last activity time. For each incoming query, increase the count of servers that did not receive requests in the last `x` milliseconds.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Deque to maintain the active query times in the window\n        active_servers = deque()\n        \n        # Hashmap to count each server's last activity time\n        last_activity = {}\n\n        # Array to store the results for each query\n        results = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove servers that haven't been active for more than 'x' milliseconds\n            while active_servers and (query - x) > active_servers[0]:\n                server_id = active_servers.popleft()\n                # Decrement the number of servers that did not receive activity for this server\n                last_activity[server_id] -= 1\n                \n            # Add the current query to the active_servers\n            active_servers.append(query)\n            \n            # For each server that was active at the current query time,\n            # adjust the last_activity time and increment the count\n            for server_id in last_activity:\n                last_activity[server_id] += 1\n\n            # Count the number of servers that have not received any request\n            count = 0\n            for server_id in last_activity:\n                if last_activity[server_id] == 0:\n                    count += 1\n            \n            results.append(count)\n\n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a deque to efficiently manage the active servers during the queries' time windows.\n- We also keep a count of each server's last activity time in a dictionary `last_activity`.\n- Each time we process a new query, we remove servers from our deque if their last activity is too far in the past, and update the `last_activity` for the current query.\n- Finally, we count the servers that have not received any requests at the current query time. ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests within a certain time interval, we can use a sliding window approach. Here's how we can implement the solution:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: We first sort the logs by the time, so that we can easily process the queries efficiently.\n\n2. **Use a Frequency Dictionary**: We'll maintain a frequency dictionary to efficiently count how many times each server ID appears within the current time window.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Logs and Queries**:\n   - For each query, adjust the sliding window by removing the first entry that falls out of the window (i.e., times[i-x]).\n   - Then, add the newly active server (if not active before) to the counter.\n   - Append the result to the output array.\n\nBelow is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort the logs by time\n        freq = defaultdict(int)  # Frequency dictionary for server IDs\n        count = 0  # The number of servers that received requests within the current window\n        active_servers = set()  # Set of servers that are currently active\n        result = []\n        \n        for time, server in logs:\n            # If the time is outside the current window, remove the first entry\n            while logs and time - logs[0][1] >= x:\n                server = logs.pop(0)[0]\n                freq[server] -= 1\n                if freq[server] == 0:\n                    count -= 1\n                    active_servers.remove(server)\n            \n            # Add the current server\n            if server not in active_servers:\n                active_servers.add(server)\n                freq[server] += 1\n                count += 1\n            \n            # Add the number of servers that have no requests in the current window to the result\n            if time - x in queries:\n                result.append(n - count)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: We sort the logs by time. This allows us to easily process each query in linear time complexity.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: We maintain a frequency dictionary to count how many times each server ID appears within the current window.\n- **Active Server Set**: We maintain a set to keep track of which server IDs are currently active. This helps us in O(1) time for checking if a server is active.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the number of servers that did not receive any requests when each query is processed, ensuring that the time complexity is O(n log n + m log m + m + q log q), where n is the number of logs, m is the number of queries, and q is the number of unique query times.\n\nThis solution effectively processes the problem by leveraging the properties of a sorted list and a frequency dictionary. ", "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many servers have not received any requests within the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]` for each query `queries[i]`. Here's how we can approach the solution:\n\n1. **Indexing and Sorting**: First, we want to store the logs sorted by increasing time.\n2. **Queries Processing**: For each query, we need to find the number of servers who have not received any requests within the time interval starting from the current query minus `x`.\n3. **Optimizing with a Map**: To efficiently manage the frequencies of server IDs, we'll keep a `Counter` variable to keep track of the number of requests received by each server.\n4. **Sliding Window**: To handle the time intervals, use a sliding window approach where you either extend the current window by including the latest query time or move it forward by removing the oldest query time.\n5. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Time complexity: O(n log n + m log m + m log n), where n is the number of logs and m is the number of queries.\n   - Space complexity: O(n + m), for the sorting and the counters.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Step 1: Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Step 2: Use a Counter to count requests for each server\n        server_count = Counter()\n        \n        # Step 3: Use a sliding window to determine how many servers are active\n        ans = []\n        left = 0\n        for query in queries:\n            # Step 4: Expand the window to include the current query time\n            while left < len(logs) and logs[left][1] <= query - x:\n                server_id = logs[left][0]\n                if server_count[server_id] == 1:\n                    n -= 1\n                server_count[server_id] += 1\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Step 5: Remove the oldest query time and update the number of servers\n            if left > 0:\n                old_server_id = logs[left - 1][0]\n                server_count[old_server_id] -= 1\n                if server_count[old_server_id] == 0:\n                    n += 1\n            \n            # Step 6: Calculate the number of active servers\n            ans.append(n)\n        \n        return ans\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: The logs are sorted by time to facilitate the use of a sliding window to manage the active servers.\n- **Counter**: We use a Counter to efficiently store and update the frequency of requests received by each server.\n- **Sliding Window**: The sliding window is maintained using two pointers `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer iterates through the logs and expands the current window, removing any servers that are no longer active when a new query arrives.\n- **Estimating the Number of Active Servers**: The `n` count is used to track how many servers have received at least one request within the current window.\n- **Answer Array**: The result is computed and stored in a list for each query.\n\nThis implementation efficiently takes O(n log n + m log m + m log n) time complexity, where n is the number of logs and m is the number of queries. We use external sorting for the logs and a Counter for efficient counting, which complements the sliding window approach. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many servers did not receive any requests during a given time interval. We'll use a sliding window approach to keep track of this count efficiently.\n\n1. **Sort the `logs`**: We'll start by sorting the `logs` to prepare for the sliding window approach. This will allow us to efficiently simulate the time progression and calculate the server requests efficiently.\n\n2. **Set up a dictionary `servers_requests`**: We'll use a dictionary to keep track of how many requests each server has received (`servers_requests[server_id] = count`).\n\n3. **Initialize a sliding window**: We'll use a list that contains all time points of interest (i.e., potential start points of the sliding window). This list will help us iterate through all potential start points of the window.\n\n4. **Process the log events**: For each time point in the sorted logs:\n   - Increment or decrement count of requests for servers within the current window.\n   - Remove servers from the `servers_requests` dictionary if they have fewer than `x` requests in the current window.\n\n5. **Map query times to counts**: For each time point in `queries`, use the `servers_requests` dictionary to determine how many servers did not receive any requests in the last `x` seconds.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs to make it easier to use a sliding window\n        logs.sort()\n        \n        # Dictionary to keep track of number of requests for each server\n        servers_requests = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # List of all time points of interest (query points + x seconds before each query)\n        time_points = [q - x for q in queries] + queries\n        time_points.sort()\n        \n        # Pointer to the current time point within the time points list\n        pointer = 0\n        # Initialize a count of servers that did not receive any requests during the x-second window\n        no_requests_count = 0\n        \n        # List to store the result\n        result = []\n        \n        for _, time in logs:\n            # Skip time points that are before the current time point\n            while pointer < len(queries) and time > time_points[pointer]:\n                # Add the number of servers that did not receive any requests at the current time point\n                result.append(no_requests_count)\n                pointer += 1\n            \n            # Add or subtract the count of requests for servers\n            servers_requests[time] += 1\n            if servers_requests[time] == x:\n                no_requests_count -= 1\n            if servers_requests[time] == 1:\n                no_requests_count += 1\n            \n            # Remove servers that have had fewer than x requests\n            while servers_requests[logs[0][1]] < x:\n                servers_requests[logs[0][1]] -= 1\n                if servers_requests[logs[0][1]] == 0:\n                    servers_requests.pop(logs[0][1])\n                    no_requests_count += 1\n                logs.pop(0)\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.countServers(n, logs, x, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We use a `defaultdict` to keep track of requests for each server, which allows us to quickly increment and decrement counts.\n- We maintain a `servers_requests` list that keeps track of server activity during the current x-second slide window.\n- The use of sorted time points helps efficiently determine which servers have no requests during the x-second window and which servers are currently active in the window.\n- This approach effectively uses a sliding window observation to efficiently answer each query. ", "\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Preprocess the Logs:** First, sort the log records by timestamp so we can efficiently determine the number of servers active for each time interval.\n\n2. **Initialize a Counter:** Maintain a counter to count the number of servers active per time interval.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Technique:**\n   - Use a sliding window with an endpoint at `queries[i]` and a start at `queries[i]-x`.\n   - For each query, calculate the number of times a server was active in this time interval (using the counter).\n\n4. **Return the Results:** Once all queries are processed, return the results in an array.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by timestamp\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary to count the number of servers active per timestamp\n        active_servers = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # List to store answers for each query\n        results = []\n        \n        # Current number of servers active for the current time interval\n        active_count = 0\n        \n        # Handle the queries one by one\n        for query in queries:\n            # Find the starting point of the time interval\n            start_time = query - x\n            \n            # Binary search to find the start of the interval in the sorted logs\n            start_index = bisect_left(logs, [0, start_time])\n            \n            # Count the number of active servers\n            for server_id, time in logs[start_index:]:\n                if time > query:\n                    break\n                # Decrement the number of servers active if we've gone beyond the query interval\n                if active_servers[server_id] > 0:\n                    active_count -= 1\n                active_servers[server_id] += 1\n                if active_servers[server_id] == 1:\n                    active_count += 1\n            \n            # Add the number of servers not active to the results\n            results.append(n - active_count)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **Sorting:** By sorting by the timestamp, we quickly identify which servers were active at different times.\n\n- **Counter:** We use a dictionary to count the number of times each server was active in a time interval. This helps us determine the number of unique servers that were active during any given time interval.\n\n- **Sliding Window:** We use two pointers to manage the time intervals and the dictionary to count the activity.\n\n- **Query Processing:** For each query, we calculate the number of servers not active in the interval `[query-x, query]`.\n\nThis method is efficient because of the use of sorted log records, binary search, and a counter.

This is done using `bisect_left` from the `bisect` module.\n\n4. **Use a List to Store Query Results**: We create a list `result` to store the number of servers that will receive no requests during each query time interval. Initially, this list is populated with all servers (`n`) since all servers could potentially receive requests during each query interval.\n\n5. **Sliding Window Approach**: We use a sliding window approach to determine how many servers are affected by each query.

The use of a set to maintain unique servers ensures each server is counted only once for each query. ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting servers that did not receive requests during a given time interval, we can utilize a data structure that tracks the timestamps of incoming requests. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the implementation:\n\n1. **Map Server IDs to Timestamps**: We will use a `defaultdict(list)` to map each server ID to a list of timestamps where it received requests.\n\n2. **Sort Query Intervals**: The `queries` array is sorted, so we need to sort the `logs` to avoid duplicates.\n\n3. **Use a Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:\n   - A min-heap (implemented using Python's `heapq` module) will help us efficiently determine the servers which have not received any requests in the current query time frame.\n   - Each query will add and remove elements from this heap based on the time received and the current window.\n\n4. **Maintain a Count of Unique Server IDs**: As new entries are added to the heap, we will update a set to keep track of unique servers that were added.\n\n5. **Result**: For each query, the result is simply the number of unique server IDs in the heap at the end of the query's time frame minus the query's time window.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to map each server to a list of timestamps\n        server_timestamps = defaultdict(list)\n        for server, timestamp in logs:\n            server_timestamps[server].append(timestamp)\n        \n        # Use a min-heap to track the servers in the current time frame\n        min_heap = []\n        # To track unique servers\n        seen_servers = set()\n        \n        # Result array\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove all servers which are not in the current time frame\n            while min_heap and min_heap[0][0] < query - x:\n                _, server_id = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n                seen_servers.remove(server_id)\n            \n            # Add new servers\n            for server_id, timestamps in server_timestamps.items():\n                # Iterate through all timestamps and get the ones within the current query\n                for timestamp in timestamps:\n                    if timestamp <= query:\n                        # Add server to heap\n                        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (timestamp, server_id))\n                        seen_servers.add(server_id)\n                    else:\n                        # Current timestamp is outside the current window\n                        break\n            \n            # The number of servers which were not seen in the current window\n            result.append(len(seen_servers))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Heap Maintenance**: We use a min-heap to keep track of the earliest timestamp received for each server. This helps in maintaining the server IDs with the earliest timestamp within the current time window.\n- **Result Calculation**: After processing each query, we calculate the number of unique servers that were not in the heap within the time frame.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the result, using both data structures to handle the problem. ", "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of servers that did not receive any requests during intervals of time. The approach involves using a sliding window technique to keep track of the requests received within the `x`-minute window centered at each query time.\n\nWe will maintain a count of unique server IDs for each request within this window. After processing each query, we compute the number of servers that did not receive any requests by subtracting the count of unique server IDs from the total number `n`.\n\nHere's the detailed implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort logs with respect to time\n        server_counts = {}  # Dictionary to count unique server IDs within the window\n        current_window = deque()  # A deque to manage time windows\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Push server IDs for the current window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] <= query:\n                current_window.append(logs[0][0])\n                server_counts[logs[0][0]] = server_counts.get(logs[0][0], 0) + 1\n                # Prune the oldest server ID\n                if len(current_window) > x:\n                    server_id_to_remove = current_window.popleft()\n                    server_counts[server_id_to_remove] -= 1\n                    if server_counts[server_id_to_remove] == 0:\n                        del server_counts[server_id_to_remove]\n                logs.pop(0)\n            \n            # Calculate the number of server IDs that didn't receive requests\n            total_servers_not_received = n - len(server_counts)\n            result.append(total_servers_not_received)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting and Tracking Requests within a Window**:\n   - We sort the `logs` based on the time they occur. This allows us to make use of a sliding window approach by moving the window forward by iterating through the logs.\n   - We use a deque to maintain the server IDs in the current window.\n\n2. **Maintaining the Count of Unique Server IDs**:\n   - For each server ID, we maintain a count of how many times it appears within the window.\n   - If a server ID is not within the current window, we drop it from the count.\n\n3. **Result Computation**:\n   - The number of servers that did not receive requests during the current query window is calculated by subtracting the total number of unique server IDs from the total number of servers `n`.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**:\n   - Sorting the logs takes O(n log n) time due to the use of `sort()`.\n   - The sliding window approach uses O(queries.length) time complexity, as each query is processed in constant time due to the deque operation.\n   - Overall complexity remains O(n log n) due to the sorting, though the complexity can be further optimized by using a data structure that allows O(1) time complexity for population and pruning instead of a deque (e.g., a hashmap).\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the given time windows, handling a potential large number of logs and queries. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of servers that did not receive any requests in the time interval [queries[i] - x, queries[i]]. We can achieve this efficiently by using a sliding window technique along with a frequency map to count the number of servers that received events.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs based on the time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Use a dictionary to count frequency of servers\n        frequency = {}\n        \n        # A queue to store server IDs for the last x time units\n        server_queue = []\n        \n        # A counter for number of servers that received events in the last x time units\n        active_count = 0\n        \n        # Initialize pointers for the log and query arrays\n        log_ptr = 0\n        query_ptr = 0\n        \n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = []\n        \n        # Iterate through the queries\n        while query_ptr < len(queries):\n            current_query = queries[query_ptr]\n            \n            # Move the log forward to the first log where its time exceeds (queries[query_ptr] - x)\n            while log_ptr < len(logs) and logs[log_ptr][1] <= current_query - x:\n                # Remove the server from the queue and update the frequency map\n                server_id = logs[log_ptr][0]\n                if server_id not in frequency:\n                    active_count -= 1\n                frequency[server_id] -= 1\n                if frequency[server_id] == 0:\n                    del frequency[server_id]\n                log_ptr += 1\n            \n            # Add the current query time's server to the queue and update the frequency map\n            if log_ptr < len(logs) and logs[log_ptr][1] == current_query:\n                server_id = logs[log_ptr][0]\n                if server_id not in frequency:\n                    active_count += 1\n                frequency[server_id] = frequency.get(server_id, 0) + 1\n                server_queue.append(server_id)\n                if server_queue[0] not in frequency:\n                    active_count -= 1\n                frequency[server_queue[0]] -= 1\n                if frequency[server_queue[0]] == 0:\n                    del frequency[server_queue[0]]\n                log_ptr += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that did not receive requests\n            result.append(n - active_count)\n            # Move to the next query\n            query_ptr += 1\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: We sort the logs based on their time as this will help with the efficient traversal and pruning.\n\n2. **Frequency Map and Queue**:\n   - Use a dictionary `frequency` to count the frequency of each server ID that is present in the window [queries[i] - x, queries[i]].\n   - Use a queue `server_queue` to track the server IDs that were processed in the current time unit (to efficiently manage the frequency of each server ID).\n\n3. **Active Count**: Keep a counter `active_count` to track how many servers are active in the current window. We will update this count as you add or remove servers from the window and from `frequency`.\n\n4. **Pointers**:\n   - Use `log_ptr` to iterate through the sorted logs, ensuring you only process logs within the time interval [queries[i] - x, queries[i]].\n   - Use `query_ptr` to iterate through the queries array.\n\n5. **Iterate through Queries**:\n   - Move the `log_ptr` forward to the next log where the time is more than `queries[query_ptr] - x`.\n   - Add the current query's server ID to the queue and update its frequency and `active_count` if it's not there yet.\n   - Check if the queue is longer than `x` and remove the oldest server ID if it's no longer present in the window.\n   - Calculate the result and add it to the list.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the logs and queries, allowing for a good time complexity of O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of logs and m is the number of queries, preventing tedious traversals of the logs and queues. ", "To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the time intervals for each server and determine how many servers did not receive requests during every query period of length `x`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs:** First, sort the `logs` by time. This helps us iterate through the logs and quickly determine the servers that received requests in a particular time interval.\n\n2. **Maintain a Frequency Map:** Use a frequency map to keep track of how many servers received requests in the current time frame.\n\n3. **Parse the Queries:**\n   - For each query `q`, calculate the time interval `[q-x, q]`.\n   - From the sorted logs, use a sliding window to determine how many servers did not receive requests during this time frame.\n   - Update the frequency map as you go along.\n\n4. **Calculate the Answer:** For each query, find the number of servers whose requests are not within the current `x`-second period.\n\nHere's the complete Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Frequency map to count server requests\n        request_count = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Helper function to process queries\n        def process_query(query_time):\n            servers_in_range = 0\n            # Remove servers from the left side of the window\n            start_time = query_time - x\n            \n            # Pointer to iterate through logs\n            j = 0\n            \n            for i, (server_id, time) in enumerate(logs):\n                # Move the window\n                while j < len(logs) and logs[j][1] <= start_time:\n                    # Remove the server from the count\n                    if request_count[logs[j][0]] == 1:\n                        servers_in_range -= 1\n                    request_count[logs[j][0]] -= 1\n                    j += 1\n                \n                # Add the current server if it has not been counted\n                if request_count[server_id] == 0:\n                    servers_in_range += 1\n                request_count[server_id] += 1\n                \n                # If the current time meets the query conditions, return\n                if time > query_time:\n                    break\n            \n            return servers_in_range\n        \n        return [process_query(q) for q in queries]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting:** By sorting the logs by time, we can easily identify requests that occurred within each `x`-second window.\n\n- **Sliding Window Logic:** Decrement requests that leave the window and increment those that enter the window.\n\n- **Frequency Map:** We use a frequency map to count how many servers received requests in the current time frame. This helps in quickly determining how many servers are in the range of the current query.\n\n- **Traversing Logs and Query:** \n  - We iterate through each query and incrementally expand the window and adjust the number of servers within the range.\n\n- **Returning the Results:** For each query, return the number of servers that were not within the `x`-second window.\n\nThis approach takes a time complexity of \\(O(N \\log N + Q \\log Q)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of logs and \\(Q\\) is the number of queries, making it efficient for large datasets. ", "Here's the completed Python code for the `countServers` method:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs based on the time column\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # A counter to keep track of the number of active servers at each moment\n        active_servers = [0] * n\n        \n        # A set to keep track of server IDs that have at least one request during the current window\n        active_server_ids = set()\n        \n        # Use a window sliding technique to focus on the moments in time in the query window\n        query_results = []\n        j = 0\n        \n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Shift the window to the right to exclude logs older than the current query time\n            while j < len(logs) and logs[j][1] <= query_time - x:\n                server_id = logs[j][0]\n                active_servers[server_id] -= 1\n                if active_servers[server_id] == 0:\n                    active_server_ids.remove(server_id)\n                j += 1\n            \n            # Add log entries within the current query window\n            while j < len(logs) and logs[j][1] < query_time:\n                server_id = logs[j][0]\n                active_servers[server_id] += 1\n                if active_servers[server_id] == 1:\n                    active_server_ids.add(server_id)\n                j += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the query time\n            num_servers_not_active = n - len(active_server_ids)\n            query_results.append(num_servers_not_active)\n        \n        return query_results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sorting Logs**: We first sort the `logs` by the `time` column. This will allow us to efficiently move the window through the logs.\n\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - We initialize a `j` index to keep track of the current position in the logs.\n   - Use a sliding window to move through the logs within the query time window ([queries[i] - x, queries[i]]):\n     - While `logs[j][1]` is less than or equal to `queries[i] - x`, it means the current log entry is out of the current window, so decrement the server count for the server at `logs[j][0]`. If this server count becomes zero, remove the server ID from `active_server_ids` to mark it as inactive.\n     - As we move forward, add the server IDs in `logs[j][0]` to `active_server_ids` and increment the server count associated with each server.\n\n   This process ensures that we efficiently manage the active servers within each query window.\n\n3. **Query Calculation**: For each query:\n   - Calculate the number of servers that were active at the start of the query (n minus the number of active server IDs).\n\nThis approach ensures a time complexity of O(n log n + q log q), where `n` is the number of logs and `q` is the number of queries, due to the sorting and for each query, we may have to scan through some logs. ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specified time interval, we can perform a careful approach using the logs. The main idea is using a sliding window to determine how many servers were active at each query time by using a log-type data structure.\n\nHere's a detailed solution implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # This data structure will allow us to efficiently count the number of servers that are active at any given time\n        server_time_map = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for server_id, time in logs:\n            server_time_map[server_id].append(time)\n            \n        # Sort the logs for each server\n        for server_id in server_time_map:\n            server_time_map[server_id].sort()\n\n        # Process queries\n        result = []\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Initialize the set to keep track of servers that were active at query time\n            active_servers = set()\n            \n            # Process each server\n            for server_id in server_time_map:\n                logs = server_time_map[server_id]\n                # Find the index where the query time would fit within the sorted logs\n                index = bisect.bisect_right(logs, query)\n                # Check if the server was active during the time interval of interest\n                if index - (index - len(logs)) >= x:\n                    active_servers.add(server_id)\n            \n            # Count the active servers\n            result.append(len(active_servers))\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# result = sol.countServers(n, logs, x, queries)\n# print(result)  # Prints the results according to the problem specifications\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Server Activity Counts**: We utilize a dictionary `server_time_map` to store the incoming logs for each server and sort them. This will allow us to efficiently determine which servers were active during a given time interval using binary search.\n  \n- **Processing Queries**:\n  - For each query, a set `active_servers` is used to track servers that were active during the time interval.\n  - For each server, binary search in the sorted list of times for each server to determine if a server was active during the query time interval. \n  - If the number of requests during the requested interval exceeds `x`, the server is added to the `active_servers` set.\n  - Finally, count the total active servers by using the length of the `active_servers` set.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the queries while leveraging the sorted logs to make the calculations more efficient. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we can utilize a sliding window technique over the logs sorted by time. We'll maintain a count of how many servers have received requests within the current sliding window, and track the number of servers that have received no requests in each interval defined by the `queries` list.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a dictionary to track server usage count\n        server_count = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # A list to hold the result for each query\n        answer = []\n        \n        # Current start index of the sliding window\n        window_start = 0\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Expand the window to the current query time\n            while logs[window_start][1] + x <= query_time:\n                server_id = logs[window_start][0]\n                server_count[server_id] += 1\n                window_start += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that received no requests\n            no_requests = n - sum(1 for count in server_count.values() if count > 0)\n            answer.append(no_requests)\n            \n            # Remove the server that left the window\n            if window_start > 0:\n                server_id = logs[window_start - 1][0]\n                server_count[server_id] -= 1\n        \n        return answer\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting Logs:** We first sort the logs based on the time they occurred. This helps in easily moving our current sliding window forward and making sure that our answer is relevant to the current query.\n- **Server Count Dictionary:** A dictionary is used to keep track of how many times each server has received requests within the current window.\n- **Sliding Window:** Each query is processed by moving the window forward to include requests that occurred before or at the current query time.\n- **Result Calculation:** For each query, the number of servers that have received no requests after the move of the window can be determined by subtracting the number of servers with counter above 0 from the total number of servers.\n- **Window Management:** If the current server has left the window, we remove its count from the dictionary. This helps maintain the window's integrity.\n\nThe algorithm ensures an efficient solution for these problems with efficient use of the dictionary by answering each query in O(n + q log n) time complexity, where `n` is the number of logs and `q` is the number of queries.

", "\nTo solve this problem, we will use a sliding window approach along with a frequency counter approach to solve this efficiently. The idea is to count the number of servers that did not receive any requests during any given time interval that ends at the current query timestamp.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to tackle this:\n\n1. **Sort the `logs`:** Sort the `logs` by timestamp for easier range selection.\n2. **Use a SortedList to maintain the current servers being queried:** Use a `SortedList` from the [SortedContainers](https://pypi.org/project/SortedContainers/) library to efficiently handle the list of servers that are currently being queried.\n3. **Use a frequency counter to track the counts:** Use a dictionary to count how many times each server ID appears in the range.\n4. **Slide the window forward:** For each query, update the list by shifting the window forward, removing the servers that no longer fall in the current time window and adding new servers.\n5. **Calculate the number of servers:** Calculate the total number of servers on both sides of the current query minus those that are in the current window.\n\nHere's the completed implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])  # Sort logs by timestamp\n        \n        # Dictionary to store the counts of each server\n        count = defaultdict(int)\n        # SortedList to track the servers being queried\n        server_list = SortedList()\n        \n        result = []  # List to store the results\n        query_index = 0  # Index for iterating over queries\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            # Shift the window forward\n            while query_index < len(logs) and logs[query_index][1] <= query - x:\n                server_id = logs[query_index][0]\n                server_list.remove(server_id)\n                count[server_id] -= 1\n                query_index += 1\n            \n            # Process the current query window\n            while query_index < len(logs) and logs[query_index][1] <= query:\n                server_id = logs[query_index][0]\n                server_list.add(server_id)\n                count[server_id] += 1\n                query_index += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that do not receive requests\n            num_servers = n - len(server_list)\n            result.append(num_servers)\n        \n        return result\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: The logs are first sorted by their timestamp (`log[1]`). This helps in easily calculating the subarrays that are affected by each query.\n\n- **SortedList**: The `SortedList` is used to maintain the server IDs that are currently being queried by the current window.\n\n- **Frequency Counter**: The `count` dictionary is used to store the number of times each server ID appears in the current window.\n\n- **Sliding Window Approach**: We track the time interval [`query - x`, `query`] and maintain the servers in the current window.\n\n- **Results**: For each query, we count the number of servers `n - len(server_list)` that are not in the current window.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles queries and is suitable for large inputs due to the use of a sorted list and dictionary.

This is important because we want to use a sliding window approach to determine when servers were active or inactive.\n\n2. **Using a Counter**: We use a counter to track the total number of requests for each server at each time point.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Approach**:\n   - We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to maintain a window of size `x`.\n   - We move `right` to the right and add to the counter for each server that receives a request.\n   - We move `left` to the right to remove servers that are inactive.\n   - Calculate the number of servers not in the window using the counter.\n\n4. **Result List**: Store the results for each query in the `result` list.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem with $O(m + k \\log m)$ time complexity where $m$ is the number of log entries, and $k$ is the number of queries.

For each interval ки , we maintain a set to keep track of the unique servers that have been active in the current query ки  window. This ки  set will efficiently ки  determine if a server has an ки  active activity ки  within that window.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by their time for easier processing\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary to track the number of servers at each time\n        active_servers = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Set to track unique servers during ки  the current interval ки \n        current_servers = set()\n        \n        result = []\n        j = 0\n        \n        # Process each query time: ки \n        for i, query in enumerate(queries):\n            # Ad ки just the active ки  servers windows ки  based on the current query\n            while j < len(logs) and logs[j][1] <= query - x:\n                _, ки  time = logs[j]\n                if active_servers[time] == 1:\n                    current_servers.remove(logs[j][0])\n                active_servers[time] -= 1\n                j += 1\n            \n            # Add the current query's start ки  time as ки  a possible candidate ки \n            current_servers.add(logs[j][0])\n            active_servers[logs[j][1]] += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the number of servers that did not receive requests\n            count ки  = n - len(current_servers)\n            result.append(count)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Sort Logs**: Sort the log ки  entries by the time to simplify the problem ки  of counting ки  servers in any ки  given interval.\n\n2. **Active Servers**: We use a dictionary `active_servers` to keep track of the number of servers that have been active at a specific time. We ки  also maintain a set `current_servers` to avoid ки  duplicates.\n\n3. **Sliding Window**: For each time ки  in the `queries` list:\n   - We move the start of the sliding window forward until it is within `x` time of the current query.\n   - We update the sets ки  accordingly to keep track of active servers.\n\n4. **Query ки  Result**: We ки  calculate the number of remaining ки  servers (`n` minus the current server ки  set) to determine how many servers did not receive request ки  in the specified ки  time interval.

Init ки ially, its ки  size is set to `n`, where indexes ки  correspond to server ids.\n   - The `SegmentTree` is initialized with the size of `n`, which corresponds to the number of servers.\n\n2. **Sort ки  the Logs**:\n   - Sort the logs by query ки  time to efficiently make ки  use of the segment tree.\n\n3. **Segment Tree Construction**:\n   - Process each log in the sorted order.\n   - For each log, update the segment tree to add the server to the list of servers that received requests during the time interval.\n\n4. **Query Processing**:\n   - For each query time, identify ки  the time interval: ки  `[t - x, t]`.\n   - Use the segment tree to count the number of servers that have at least one request in the given time interval.\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - Each query result is stored in a list and returned.\n\nHere is the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass SegmentTree:\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.tree = defaultdict(list)\n        self.n = n\n\n    def update(self, start, end, index):\n        self.update_helper(0, self.n - 1, start, end, 0, index)\n\n    def update_helper(self, start, end, left, right, idx ки , index):\n        if start > right or end < left:\n            return\n\n        if start >= left and end <= right:\n            self.tree[idx].append(index)\n            return\n\n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        left_idx = 2 * idx + 1\n        right_idx = 2 * idx + 2\n\n        self.update_helper(start, mid, left, right, left_idx, index)\n        self.update_helper(mid + 1, end, left, right, right_idx, index)\n\n    def query(self, start, end):\n        return self.query_helper(0, self.n - 1, start, end, 0)\n\n    def query_helper(self, start, end, left, right, idx):\n        if start > right or end < left:\n            return set()\n\n        if start >= left and end <= right:\n            return set(self.tree[idx])\n\n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        left_idx = 2 * idx + 1\n        right_idx = 2 * idx + 2\n\n        return ки  (self.query_helper(start, mid, left, right, left_idx) |\n                self.query_helper(mid + 1, end, left, right, right_idx))\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Initialize segment tree with n leaves\n        segment_tree = SegmentTree(n)\n        \n        # Sort logs by time to process segments ки  efficiently\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        result = []\n        \n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Get ки  the time interval for the query: ки  [query_time - x, query_time]\n            start_time = query_time - x\n            end_time = query_time\n            \n            # Use segment tree to find the number of servers active ки  in this interval\n            active_servers = segment_tree.query(start_time, end_time)\n            result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n            \n            # Update the segment tree for the active ки  servers in the current interval\n            for server_id in active_servers:\n                segment_tree.update(0, n - 1, server_id)\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.countServers(n, logs, x, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **SegmentTree Class**: The `SegmentTree` class implements the basic ки  operations to manage segments ки  of the range ки . Each ки  node maintains a list of servers that have received requests during the corresponding time interval.\n\n- **SegmentTree Construction**: We process each log as ки  it' ки s sorted by time, updating the segment tree with the corresponding server index for each log's time range.\n\n- **Queries**: For each query, identify ки  the interval `[query_time - x, query_time]` and use the segment tree to determine how many servers are active in this interval, ки  which can be represented ки  by their ки  indexes.\n\n- **Result**: The result is stored in a list ` ки result` and returned after processing all queries.  ки ", "To solve the problem of calculating ки  the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specific time interval, we can utilize a sliding window approach with a set to track which ки  servers have sent requests in the given time window.\n\nThe idea is to maintain a set of server IDs that have sent requests in the current time window, and add ки  them ки  to a count. ки  Once ки  the window reaches ки  the end of a query, remove any server IDs that are no longer in the window, and continue with the next query. \n\nHere's the complete implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by the ки  time, ки  which allows us to process them in order\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Dictionary ки  to map each server ID to the last time it sent a request\n        server_times = {server: -1 for server in range(1, n + 1)}\n        \n        # Set to store server IDs during ки  the current sliding window\n        current_servers = SortedList()\n        \n        result ки  = []\n        query_index = 0\n\n ки         for query in queries:\n            # Find ки  the start of the current query window\n            start_time = query - x\n            \n            # Remove server IDs from the set if they are no longer in the window\n            while current_servers and current_servers[0][1] < start_time:\n                server = current_servers[0][0]\n                current_servers.remove([server, server_times[server]])\n\n            # Add new logs until we reach the end of the current query window\n            while query_index < len(logs) and logs[query_index][1] <= query:\n                server, time = logs[query_index]\n                current_servers.add([server, time])\n                server_times[server] = time\n                query_index += 1\n\n            # The number of servers not receiving requests is n minus the size of current_servers\n            result.append(n - len(current_servers))\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.countServers(3, [[1, 3], [2, 6], [1, 5]], 5, [5, 6]))  # Example call\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We first sort the logs by the time they occur in ки  order to process them efficiently.\n\n2. **Server Time Dictionary**: This dictionary tracks ки  the last time each server sent a request.\n\n3. **Sliding Window**: We use ` ки SortedList` to efficiently maintain the active ки  servers during the current window.\n\n4. **Iterative ки  Processing**: \n   - We process each query one by one.

We can achieve this efficiently using a de ки que (or a sliding window technique) to track the time windows and a counter to count the number of servers that were not active during each time window.\n\nHere's the Python ки  code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort logs by time to process them in order\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Use a deque to maintain a sliding window of size x\n        active_servers = deque()\n        \n        # A counter to keep track of the number of active servers at each time\n        counter ки  = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Process each log\n        for server_id, time in logs:\n            # Remove elements ки  from the beginning ки  of the queue that are no longer active\n            while active_servers and time - active_servers[0] >= x:\n                left ки _server = active_servers.popleft()\n                counter[left_server] -= 1\n            \n            # Add the new server to the queue\n            active_servers.append(time)\n            counter[server_id] += 1\n        \n        result = []\n        for query_time in queries:\n            # Count the number of servers that are not active at this query time\n            while active_servers and query_time - active_servers[0] >= x:\n                left_server = active_servers.popleft()\n                counter[left_server] -= 1\n            \n            total ки _active = sum(count > 0 for count in counter.values())\n            result.append(n - total_active)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting Logs**: First, we sort the `logs` list by their second ки  column (the `time`). This allows us to process the log ки  records ки  in order, so ки  we don ки 't miss any active ки  time ки  windows and ки  correctly compute ки  accurate ки  counts.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a `deque` to maintain a sliding window of size `x`. Each time we process a log, we compare ки  the current time to the first element in the deque. We ки  remove elements from the deque that have been inactive for ` ки x` or more time units.\n\n3. **Server Counting**: We maintain a counter to count the number of servers that are currently active. We add servers ки  to the counter and remove servers from the counter when they leave the window.\n\n4. **Query Processing**: For each query, we adjust the sliding window by removing any servers that were ки  recorded ки  as inactive at the time of this ки  query. The remaining unique ки  servers in the counter represent those that are not active.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines ки  the number of servers not active for each query using a combination of sorting and a sliding window.  ки ", "To solve the problem of calculating ки  the number of servers that did not receive requests during a given time range ки , we can break ки  it down into two steps:\n\n1.

For each query, calculate the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`.

This allows us to iter ки ate through the sorted data ки  efficiently using the sliding window technique.\n\n- **Dictionary Tracking**: We use a dictionary, `server_requests`, to count the number of requests received by each server.\n\n- **Sliding Window**: We maintain a window ` ки [left, right]` that initially ки  covers the time range `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]`. This ки  approach ки  ensures the right ки  boundary of the window remains within each ки  query's time range.

This accounts ки  for incoming ки  requests.\n- **Sliding Window**: We then consider ки  the log entries that started before `t - x`, as ки  these are outside the current query's window. We update the unique ки  requests counter and the Counter dictionary ки .\n- **Result Calculation**: For each query, we compute the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the latest ки  interval ( ки `[t - x, t]`), which is `n - |unique_requests|`.\n\nThis efficient ки  solution efficiently processes the problem by leveraging the sorting, Counter, and sliding window properties ки .  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of servers that did not receive any requests within the last `x` seconds for each query. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs by Time**: This ки  will help us identify servers that did not receive any requests during the interval ки  [t-x, t] where t is the current query time.\n2. **Use a Sliding Window Technique**: We'll maintain a queue ки  of servers receiving ки  the ки  most recent requests for ки  the last `x` seconds.\n3. **Process ки  Queries**: For each query, count the number of servers in the current window that have not received requests up ки  to the current time ( ки t).\n4. **Return the Results**: For each query, compute the count of servers not receiving any requests and return it in the array `arr`.\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # List ки  to keep ки  track of servers sorted ки  by most recent access ки  time\n        most_recent_access_times = [0] * n\n\n        # Deque for servers ки  that did ки  not receive any requests in the last x seconds\n        no_requests_in_x_seconds = deque()\n        \n        # Array ки  to store the result for each query\n        result = []\n\n        for query in queries:\n            # Remove servers that have been ки  in the deque for more than x seconds\n            while no_requests_in_x_seconds and query - no_requests_in_x_seconds[0][0] > x:\n                server_id, _ = no_requests_in_x_seconds.popleft()\n                most_recent_access_times[server_id] = ки  -1  # Mark as unused\n\n            # Add the current query time to all servers that are not in the deque\n            # ки  because ки  it ки 's their ки  earliest ки  possible access time\n            i ки  = 0\n            while i < len(logs) and logs[i][1] <= query - x:\n                # ки  Add this server to the current ки  window if ки  it's not in the deque\n                # and it's not marked as unused\n                if ( ки most_recent_access_times[logs[i][0] - 1] <= query - x\n                    and logs[i][1] <= query - x):\n                    no_requests_in_x_seconds.append((logs[i][1], logs[i][0] - 1))\n                    most_recent_access_times[logs[i][0] - 1] = logs[i][1]\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            # Count servers that are not accessed ки  by any request in the window ки \n            count = n - len(no_requests_in_x_seconds)\n            result.append(count)\n\n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting Logs**: Sort the logs by time. This helps us easily identify the server ки 's last request time.\n\n- **Sliding Window**:  ки \n  - Use a deque `no_requests_in_x_seconds` to keep track of servers that did not receive any requests in the last `x` seconds. \n  - Maintain a list `most_recent_access_times` to store the most recent access time of each server. \n\n- **Up ки dating the Window**: \n  - For each query, remove servers from the window ки  that have been idle for more than `x` seconds and ки  mark these ки  servers as unused. \n  - Then, add servers that have not received any requests into ки  the window since ки  the current query time if ки  they are not marked as unused by ки  the most recent access time.\n\n- **Counting Servers**: \n  - When ки  a query is done ки , the number of servers in the `no_requests_in_x_seconds` deque represent the number of servers that did not receive any requests within the last `x` seconds. Hence ки , the difference between the total servers (`n`) and the length of the deque is the number of servers not receiving requests for ки  the current query. \n\nThis method ки  ensures that each query is processed efficiently with a guaranteed ки  time complexity in ки  `O(n log n + m log m + q log n)`, where `n` is the number of servers, `m` is the number of logs, and `q` is the number of queries. This is efficient due to the use of sorting, sliding windows, and binary ки  search.  ки ", "To solve this problem efficiently ки , we can utilize a sliding window technique with a tim ки eline to track the number of requests received during ки  each query time interval. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: We sort the `logs` array by time. This is ки  important because we'll use a sliding window to determine the number of requests handled ки  within a specific time interval.\n\n2. **Use a Double ки -Ended Queue (deque) to Track Active Server IDs**: This ки  data structure allows us to efficiently track ки  the servers with ки  activity within each sliding window. Every ки  time a server requests ки  arrives ки , we add it to the deque, and every time a request' ки s exp ки iration exceeds ки  the current window, we remove it from the deque.\n\n3. **Iterate through the Queries**: For each query in ки  the `queries` array, we determine the required ки  window and count the active servers within that window.\n\n4. **Track ки  Total ки  Active Servers in ки  the Deque**: As we forward ки  the query to ки  the next time, we keep ки  track of the total active servers by considering ки  the size ки  of the deque.\n\nHere is the implementation of this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort the logs based on the time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a deque to hold ки  server IDs\n        active_servers = deque()\n        # A counter array ки  to track active servers at each timestamp\n        count_at_time = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n        # Calcul ки ate the number of active servers at each time\n        for server_id, timestamp in logs:\n            # Ad ки just the count of active servers by ки  adding the new entry ки \n            count_at_time[server_id] += 1\n            if count_at_time[server_id] >  ки 1:\n                # If it's the second request for this server, remove ки  it from the deque\n                active_servers.remove(server_id)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, add it to the deque\n                active_servers.append(server_id)\n            \n            # En ки sure that the active ки _servers deque has at most n elements, ки  removing old tim ки estamps\n            if len(active_servers) > n:\n                # Remove the first server ID from the deque\n                last ки _server_id = active_servers.popleft()\n                # Update the count for this server ID\n                count_at_time[last_server_id] -= 1\n\n        # Calcul ки ate the number of servers at ки  each query\n        answer = []\n        for query in queries:\n            # Calculate the period ки  for the current query\n            start_time = query - x\n            # Count servers that handled ки  requests up ки  to this point\n            num_active_servers = sum(count_at_time[1:])\n            # Handle ки  servers that might ки  not have the ки  full period ( ки from ки  start_time to query)\n            for server_id, count_ ки at_t in enumerate(count_at_time[1:], start=1):\n                if count_at_t == 0:\n                    continue\n                if logs[0][1] <= start_time:\n                    if logs[0][1] + x <= query:\n                        num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n                if logs[-1][1] <= start_time:\n                    if logs[-1][1] + x <= query:\n                        num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n                if start_time <= logs[0][1] and logs[-1][1] <= query:\n                    num_active_servers -= 1\n                    break\n            answer.append(num_active_servers)\n        \n        return answer\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the queries by using a sliding window and a deque to keep track of active servers while ки  maintaining efficiency ки . Since ки  the input ки  data is sorted, we can use this to find ки  the required ки  active server count in each ки  query in O(n + m log n + q log n) time complexity ( ки where n is the number of servers and m is the number of requests, and q is the number of queries), making it suitable for high ки  performance ки  on large server ки  sets.\n\n ки ", "To solve this problem, we need to manage ки  the frequency ки  of server usage ки  in queries ки  of ` ки x` time units before a query time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Init ки ialize a Counter**: We will use a counter `count` to track how many times each server has been seen ки  within the last `x` time units.\n\n2. **Sort the Logs**: We sort the logs based on their time st ки amps, since we'll be iterating through the logs and removing ки  servers from the count as soon ки  as they are no longer within the time frame we ки 're interested in.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Log ки ic**: We'll use a sliding window to count ки  the frequency of servers that have been seen in the last `x` units of time.\n\n4. **Maintain a Set**: We will maintain a set `servers_in_time` to track the servers that have been seen within our ки  current window.\n\n5. **Iterate through Queries**: For each query time, we adjust ки  our counter by removing servers that were seen more than `x` time units ago.

This makes it easier to calculate ки  the number of servers active at any given timestamp.\n\n- **SortedList**: We use a sorted list (`SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` library) to efficiently keep track of the active servers as ки  we process each timestamp.\n\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: We use two pointers to efficiently ки  control ки  the window of interest.\n\nThis ки  solution efficiently handles the problem and ки  is well-suited for large data sets due to the use of sorted lists and a two-pointer technique.  ки ", "\nThis ки  problem requires answering ки  the number of servers that did not receive any requests for a given time interval. The key observation is that for each query, we only need to track the number of servers that did not receive requests during the last `x` seconds before the current query.\n\nHere's how you can solve the problem:\n\n1. **Sort Logs by Time**: The first step is to sort the `logs` with ки  respect to time. This will help us efficiently track the number of servers that received requests.\n\n2. **Use a Monotonic Queue to Track Recently ки  Active Servers**: Use a deque to maintain a list of servers that were active during the last `x` seconds.

Here's how we can implement the solution:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: We first sort the logs by the time, so that we can easily process the queries efficiently.\n\n2. **Use a Frequency Dictionary**: We'll maintain a frequency dictionary to efficiently ки  count how many times each server ID appears within the current time window.\n\n3. **Iter ки ate Through Log ки s and Queries**:\n   - For each query, adjust ки  the sliding window by removing the first entry ки  that falls out of the window (i.e., times ки [i-x]).\n   - Then ки , add the newly ки  active ки  server (if ки  not active ки  before) to the counter ки .\n   - Ap ки pend the result to the output array.\n\nBelow ки  is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort the logs by time\n        freq = defaultdict(int)  # Frequency dictionary for server IDs\n        count = 0  # The ки  number of servers that received requests within the current window\n        active_servers = set()  # Set of servers that are currently active\n        result = []\n        \n        for time, server in logs:\n            # If the time is outside the current window, remove the first entry\n            while logs and time - logs[0][1] >= x:\n                server = logs.pop(0)[0]\n                freq[server] -= 1\n                if freq[server] == 0:\n                    count -= 1\n                    active_servers.remove(server)\n            \n            # Add the current server\n            if server not in active_servers:\n                active_servers.add(server)\n                freq[server] += 1\n                count += 1\n            \n            # Add the number of servers that have no requests in the current window to the result\n            if time - x in queries:\n                result.append(n - count)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sorting**: We sort the logs by time. This allows us to easily process each query in linear time complexity.\n- **Frequency Dictionary**: We maintain a frequency dictionary to count how many times each server ID appears within the current window.\n- **Active Server Set**: We maintain a set to keep track of which server IDs are currently active. This helps us in ки  O(1) time for checking if a server is active.\n\nThis approach efficiently calcul ки ates the number of servers that did not receive any requests when ки  each query is processed, ensuring that the time complexity is O(n log n + m log m + m + q log q), where n is the number of logs, m is the number of queries, and q is the number of unique query ки  times.\n\nThis solution effectively processes the problem by leveraging the properties of a sorted list and a frequency dictionary.  ки ", "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many servers have ки  not received any requests within the time interval `[queries[i] - x, queries[i]]` for each query `queries[i]`.

The `left` pointer iter ки ates through the logs and expands the current window, removing any servers that are no longer active when ки  a new query arrives.\n- **Est ки imating the Number of Active Servers**: The `n` count ки  is used to track how many servers have received at least one request within the current window.\n- **Answer Array**: The result is computed ки  and stored in a list for each query.\n\nThis implementation efficiently takes ки  O(n log n + m log m + m log n) time complexity, where n is the number of logs and m is the number of queries.

If this server count becomes zero, remove the server ID from `active_server_ids` to ки  mark it as inactive.\n     - As ки  we move forward, add the server IDs in ки  `logs[j][0]` to `active_server_ids` and increment the server count associated ки  with each server.\n\n   ки  This process ensures that we efficiently manage the active servers within each query window.\n\n3. **Query Calculation**: For each query: ки \n   - Calculate the number of servers that were active at the start of the query (n ки  minus the number of active server IDs).\n\nThis approach ensures a ки  time complexity of O(n log n + q log q), where `n` is the number of logs and `q` is the number of queries, due to the sorting and for ки  each query, we may ки  have to scan ки  through some logs.  ки ", "\nTo solve the problem of counting the number of servers that did not receive any requests during a specified time interval, we can perform ки  a careful ки  approach using the logs.

This will ки  allow us to efficiently determine which servers were active during a given time interval using binary search.\n  \n- **Process ки ing Queries**:\n  - For each query, a ки  set `active_servers` is used to track servers that were active during the time interval.\n  - For each server, binary search in ки  the sorted list of times for each server to determine if a ки  server was active during the query time interval.  ки \n  - If the number of requests during the requested ки  interval exceeds `x`, the server is added to the `active_servers` set.\n  - Finally, count ки  the total ки  active servers by ки  using the length of the `active_servers` set.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the queries ки  while leveraging the sorted logs to make ки  the calculations more efficient.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we can utilize a sliding window technique over ки  the logs sorted by time.

This allows us to easily identify ки  which servers should ки  become ки  active in the current time interval.\n- **Using a Deque:** We use a deque to efficiently manage the current list ки  of active servers. The deque allows constant ки  time insertion and removal from either end.\n- **Ke ки eping Counts:** We use a `defaultdict` to maintain a count of each server across ки  different ки  time intervals.\n- **Sliding Window:** For each query, we determine which servers are in the current window, which we ки  track ки  using the deque and the `defaultdict`.\n- **Response Calculation:** For each query, we calculate the number of servers that did not receive a request by ки  subtracting the current number of servers in the window from the total number of possible ки  servers `n`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the properties of ordered ки  logs and a sliding window technique.  ки ", "\nHere is the complete Python implementation ки  of the `countServers` method:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # Count ки  of requests received by each server\n        server_count = [0] * (n + 1)\n        # Current ки  servers ки  that are active\n        active_servers = set()\n        # Deque to keep track of server ки  request ки  intervals\n        request_q ки  = deque()\n\n        # Initialize window ки  variables ки \n        left_index = 0\n        right_index = 0\n        count_active_servers = 0\n\n        # Use ки  two pointers technique ки  to slide the query window\n        result = []\n        for query in queries:\n            # Move the right pointer to the query position\n            while right_index < len(logs) and logs[right_index][1] <= query:\n                s ки id = logs[right_index][0]\n                if server_count[sid] == 0:\n                    count_active_servers += 1\n                server_count[sid] += 1\n                active_servers.add(sid)\n                request_q.append(logs[right_index][1])\n                right_index += 1\n            \n            # Move the left pointer to remove the ки  oldest request\n            while request_q and request_q[0] + x <= query:\n                if ки  request_q[0] + x <= query:\n                    sid = logs[left_index][0]\n                    server_count[sid] -= 1\n                    # ки  If the count becomes 0, remove the server from active\n                    if server_count[sid] == 0:\n                        count_active_servers -= 1\n\n ки                     # Remove the oldest request time\n                    request_q.popleft()\n                    if sid in active_servers:\n                        active_servers.remove(sid)\n                left_index += 1\n\n            # The count of active servers not ки  receiving requests is the answer for this query\n            result.append(n - count_active_servers)\n\n        return result\n\n\n ки # Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.countServers(3, [[1, 3], [2, 6], [1, 5]], 5, [10, 11]))\n```\n\n### Explanation of ки  the Solution:\n\n1. **Sorting Logs**: First, we sort the `logs` based on increasing ки  ` ки time`. This allows us to easily manage the active request ки  intervals using a queue.\n\n2. **Deque and Counting**: We use a `deque` to keep track of the request times for each server, and a separate ки  `server_count` array to count the total requests received by each server. We also maintain a `count_active_servers` to keep track of the number of servers that are currently active.\n\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to manage the query that ки  gradually ки  increases ки  the range ки  of the window while ки  tracking ки  the new ки  and old requests simultaneously ки .\n\n4. **Query Results ки **: For each query, we compute the answer ки  as `n - count_active_servers`. This is because the number of servers not receiving requests during the current window is `n` minus the number of active servers.\n\nThis solution efficiently manages the sliding window in ки  O(n log n + m log m), where `n` is the total number of servers and `m` is the total number of queries.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider ки  the following ки :\n\n- At ки  each query time, count how many servers have not received any requests in the interval [t-x, t].\n- We can efficiently track server requests using a set ки  or map ки  that tracks ки  the last time each server received a request.\n\nHere's the implemented ки  Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by timestamp\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # Initialize a sorted list to store the server IDs sorted ки  by their last activity ки \n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        # Dictionary to store the frequency of active ки  servers at each timestamp\n        active_counts = {}\n\n        # Define ки  the function ки  to check how many servers are active\n        def get_active_count(t: int) -> int:\n            # Remove servers that are not active\n ки             while active_servers and active_servers[0][0] < t - x:\n                # Incre ки ment the last ки  activity of server ки  by ки  x\n                current ки _time, server = active_servers.pop(0)\n                active_servers.add((current_time + x, server))\n                active_counts[server] -= 1\n                if active_counts[server] == 0:\n                    del active_counts[server]\n            \n            # Return the number of servers after ки  removing out ки dated ones\n            return len(active_counts)\n\n        # Initialize the output ки  array\n        result = []\n        # Process each query\n        for idx ки , t in enumerate(queries):\n            # Add the current log to the active list\n            if logs[idx]:\n                current_time, server = logs[idx]\n                active_servers.add((current_time, server))\n                if server in active_counts:\n                    active_counts[server] += 1\n                else:\n                    active_counts[server] = 1\n            # Compute the answer for the query at ки  time t\n            result.append(get_active_count(t))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting Logs**: Sort the logs by timestamp ` ки t`. This helps in efficiently determining ки  the active servers in each query interval.\n\n2. **Using a SortedList**: We maintain a sorted list (`active_servers`) to efficiently manage the active servers. Each item in the list consists of a tuple `(t, server_id)` where `t` is the last request time for the server.\n\n3. **Using a Dictionary**: We keep ки  a dictionary `active_counts` to track how many times each server has been active.\n\n4. **Get ки ting Active Count**: For each time ки  `t`, we remove and ки  account ки  for servers that have not been active for more than `x` units of time. We return ки  the number of currently ки  active servers at that point.\n\nThis solution efficiently tracks and accounts ки  for the active servers within the required time interval, ensuring we compute ки  the number ки  of active servers at each time ки  relevant ки  to the given queries.  ки ", "\nHere's the Python code to complete the task:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda log: log[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a SortedList to store the server IDs for each active ки  log ки  window\n        active_servers = SortedList()\n        # A counter to keep track of the number of active servers in each query\n        active_count = {}\n        \n        # Initialize the start and end index for the logs' ки  sliding window\n        start = 0\n        \n        # Process each query\n        result = []\n        for query in queries:\n            # Expand the window to include requests ки  up to the current query\n            end = start + x - 1\n            while end < len(logs) and logs[end][1] <= query:\n                server_id = logs[end][0]\n                # Add the server ID to the SortedList\n                active_servers.add(server_id)\n                # Increment the count of this server ID\n                active_count[server_id] = active_count.get(server_id, 0) + 1\n                # Move the window forward\n                end += 1\n            \n            # Remove the out ки  of bounds servers from the window\n            while start < end and logs[start][1] < query - x:\n                # Remove the server ID from the SortedList\n                active_servers.remove(logs[start][0])\n                # Decrement the count for the removed server ID\n                active_count[logs[start][0]] -= 1\n                # Remove the server ID with count zero from the active_count dictionary\n                if active_count[logs[start][0]] == 0:\n                    del active_count[logs[start][0]]\n                # Move the window forward\n                start += 1\n            \n            # The number of servers not used ки  in the current query would ки  be the total minus the number of servers in the current SortedList\n            result.append(n - len(active_servers))\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **SortedList**: We use `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` library to efficiently manage the servers that are currently in ки  the active time ки  window.\n- **Main ки  Loop and ки  Window Management**:\n  - We first ки  sort the `logs` by the time to facilitate easy management of the time window.\n  - We use two indices `start` and `end` to manage our sliding window.

We'll need ки  to maintain a sliding window where ки  we count the requests from ки  each server continuously ки .\n\nThis ки  can be efficiently done with a hash ки map or a count ки  of servers sorted ки  by request ки  time, which will allow us to check ки  how many servers are relevant ки  at each query time.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Sort the logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize the results ки  list\n        results = []\n        \n        # Initial ки  window ки  of the sorted logs\n        window = deque()\n        \n        # Count of each server's requests\n        server_count = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Number of unique servers in the current window\n        unique_servers_in_window = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each query\n        for i ки  in range(len(queries)):\n            query_time = queries[i]\n            # Shrink the window to the range [query time ки  - x, query time]\n            while window and window[0][1] + x <= query_time:\n                # If the earliest request in the queue ки  was ки  from the same server, decrement its count\n                server_id, _ = window.popleft()\n                server_count[server_id] -= 1\n                if server_count[server_id] == 0:\n                    unique_servers_in_window -= 1\n            \n            # Add new requests to the window\n            while logs and logs[0][1] <= query_time:\n                server_id, _ = logs.pop(0)\n                if server_id not in server_count:  ки  # New server\n                    unique_servers_in_window += 1\n                server_count[server_id] += 1\n                window.append((server_id, query_time))\n            \n            # Calculate the result for this query\n            num_servers_non ки _active = unique_servers_in_window - (sum(1 for count in server_count.values() if count > 0) if any ки (count > 0 for count in server_count.values()) else 0)\n            results.append(num_servers_non_active)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sort the Logs**: First, sort the logs by their time values ки . This enables ки  us to process requests in order and easily determine when requests are within a specific time interval.\n\n2. **Window Processing**:\n   - A ки  deque (double-ended queue) is used to represent ки  the log ки  intervals ки  that are currently being considered.\n   - We maintain a map ки  `server_count` to count the total ки  requests for each server id ки .\n   - `unique_servers_in_window` keeps track of the number of unique servers that are currently in the window.\n\n3. **Query Processing**:\n   - For each query, we first \" ки shrink\" the window by removing requests outside of the range [query_time - x, query_time].\n   - Then, we add new requests to the window.\n   - Finally, we compute the result by subtracting all ки  servers that received at least one request from the number of unique servers in the window.\n\n4. **Notes ки **:\n   - Since ки  server ки  IDs are unique, we can efficiently ки  count them ки  and ки  identify ки  servers with no requests in the current window.\n   - The code ки  handles corner cases appropriately ки , such as when a server doesn ки 't appear ки  in the first `x` seconds after a query or ки  a ки  query itself ки  doesn't include any new requests. \n\nThis approach efficiently updates ки  the window as ки  new information ки  is added, ensuring that the number of servers active ки  in any time interval is easily ки  computed with ки  minimal processing.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently count the number of servers that did not receive any requests during each time interval specified in the `queries` array.\n\nThe key observation is that for each query, we need to determine the number of servers that did not receive requests in the interval [query_time - x, query_time]. This can be efficiently achieved using the ки  following approach:\n\n1. **Sort the logs** based on time to maintain chronological ordering.\n2. **Ap ки proach each query in queries**. ки  For each query, use a sliding window technique to identify ки  servers that did not receive requests during the time interval.\n3. **Use a frequency counter** to keep track of how many times each server ID appears.\n4. **Maintain a counter** to determine how many servers have no requests in the current window.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countServers(self, n: int, logs: List[List[int]], x: int, queries: List[int]):\n        # Sort logs by time\n        logs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n        \n        # Initialize a counter for each server\n        # ки  This will hold ки  the frequency of each server ID\n        server_counts = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # List ки  for ки  storing the results\n        results = []\n        \n        # Current ки  start and end of the window\n        window_start = 0\n        window_end = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each query\n        for query in queries:\n            # Find the start of the current window\n            window_start = query - x\n            \n            # Sh ки ift the window to include this query\n            while window_end < len(logs) and logs[window_end][1] <= query:\n                server_counts[logs[window_end][0]] += 1\n                window_end += 1\n            \n            # Shift the window left ки  until the new ки  start time\n            while window_start > logs[window_start - 1][1]:\n                server_counts[logs[window_start - 1][0]] -= 1\n                window_start += 1\n            \n            # Count servers that have no requests in the current window\n            no_requests_count = sum(1 for count in server_counts.values() if count == 0)\n            results.append(n - no_requests_count)\n        \n        return results\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a ` ки bisect`-based approach to find the starting index of the window for each query.

{"idx": 2, "pred": ["\nHere's a complete implementation of the `relocateMarbles` method in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # We will use a set to keep track of the positions that are occupied\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Process each move instruction\n        for src, dest in zip(moveFrom, moveTo):\n            # If a marble was already at the source position, move it to the destination\n            if src in occupied:\n                occupied.remove(src)\n                occupied.add(dest)\n        \n        # Sort the occupied positions\n        return sorted(occupied)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We start by using a `set(nums)` to store the initial positions of the marbles. This set will allow us to efficiently check which positions are occupied.\n\n2. **Each Move:**\n   - For each move, check if the source position exists in the `occupied` set. If it does, remove it from the set and add the destination.\n\n3. **Final Sort:**\n   - After processing all the moves, convert the set to a sorted list and return it.\n", "\nTo solve this problem, we can adopt a set-based approach to efficiently track and handle marbles' positions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initial Set Construction**: We begin by building a set of initial positions `nums`, which helps in quickly checking if a position has at least one marble.\n\n2. **Handle Moves**: For each move (position change), we remove the existing position from the set and add the moved position to it. This helps maintain a set of unique occupied positions.\n\n3. **Sorting the Result**: Finally, we convert the set to a sorted list and return it.\n\nHere's the implemented solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Step 1: Create a set of initial positions\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Step 2: Process each move\n        for i in range(len(moveFrom)):\n            # Step 2.1: Remove the position with the marble\n            if moveFrom[i] in occupied:\n                occupied.remove(moveFrom[i])\n            # Step 2.2: Add the new position\n            occupied.add(moveTo[i])\n        \n        # Step 3: Sort and return the result\n        return sorted(occupied)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.relocateMarbles([1, 6, 7, 8], [1, 7, 2], [2, 9, 5]))  # Output: [2, 5, 6, 9]\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use a set `occupied` to store the currently occupied positions. Initializing the set with the initial positions helps in O(n) complexity, where n is the number of initial positions.\n- For each move, we first remove the position where a marble was originally at (for a pre-existing position) and then add the new position (for a non-existent position). This ensures that each position is represented accurately.\n- Finally, we return a sorted list of the occupied positions, which is a constant-time operation (in terms of number of occupied positions).\n\nThis approach efficiently keeps track of changes to the marble positions and ensures an efficient result. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to perform a series of moves on the positions of the marbles and then return the sorted list of occupied positions. Here's the step-by-step plan for the solution:\n\n1. Initialize a set to track the unique positions.\n2. For each move, remove the positions where the marbles currently are, and then add the moveTo position.\n3. After all moves are completed, convert the set to a list and sort it.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        positions = set(nums)\n        \n        for i in range(len(moveFrom)):\n            if moveFrom[i] in positions:\n                positions.remove(moveFrom[i])\n            positions.add(moveTo[i])\n        \n        return sorted(positions)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: We first convert the `nums` list into a set to efficiently check if a position has a marble.\n- **Step 2**: For each step, remove any existing marbles at the `moveFrom` position, and then add the new position `moveTo`.\n- **Step 3**: Finally, convert the set of occupied positions to a sorted list and return it. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we want to simulate the movement of marbles and keep track of which positions are occupied. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Model the Marbles**: Use a set to represent the current positions of the marbles. This will help efficiently handle the adding and removing of marbles at each position.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Moves**: For each move to update the set of positions, perform the following steps:\n   - Remove any marbles at the `moveFrom[i]` position using `set.discard()`.\n   - Add a marble at the `moveTo[i]` position using `set.add()`.\n\n3. **Sort and Return**: After processing all moves, sort the positions in the set to get the final sorted list.\n\nThe steps are implemented as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        marbles = set(nums)\n        \n        for move_from, move_to in zip(moveFrom, moveTo):\n            marbles.discard(move_from)\n            marbles.add(move_to)\n        \n        return sorted(list(marbles))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial Set Conversion**: We convert the list `nums` into a set `marbles`, ensuring that no duplicate positions are included.\n\n- **Loop Through Moves**: For each move, we remove the marble from its current position (`moveFrom[i]`) using `set.discard()`, and then add it to the new position (`moveTo[i]`).\n\n- **Convert and Sort**: Finally, we convert back to a list and sort it, ensuring that the result is in ascending order.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the movement of marbles using a set and straightforward operations, ", "\nTo solve the problem of relocating marbles and determining the sorted list of occupied positions, you can leverage a data structure that efficiently handles the movement and checks for occupied positions.

For each pair, if `from` is in `marble_counts`, it means there is at least one marble in that position. We then move all marbles from `from` to `to` and update `marble_counts` accordingly.\n\n3. **Counting Occupied Positions**: Finally, we extract the keys of the `marble_counts` dictionary representing positions with at least one marble and sort them to get the result. This ensures the result is sorted and distinct.\n\nThis approach efficiently manages the relocation and counting, and meets the requirements in O(n + m) time complexity, where `n` is the number of marbles and `m` is the number of relocation operations. ", "To solve the problem of relocating marbles with a given set of instructions, we can implement the solution step-by-step.

This will help us efficiently determine if a position is occupied.\n\n2. **Relocation Process**:\n   - For each step in `moveFrom` and `moveTo`, identify the marbles at the `from` position and move them to the `to` position. This can be done by iterating over indices such that the marbles' positions can be modified in-place.\n   - Update the `occupied` set accordingly.\n\n3. **Final List Comprehension**: After completing all steps, return the sorted list of occupied positions. A list comprehension is used for this, eliminating any duplicates from the `occupied` set.\n\nBelow is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize a set to track occupied positions\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Perform relocation steps\n        for i in range(len(moveFrom)):\n            from_pos = moveFrom[i]\n            to_pos = moveTo[i]\n            \n            # If there are marbles at the from position, move them to the to position\n            if from_pos in occupied:\n                occupied.remove(from_pos)\n                occupied.add(to_pos)\n        \n        # Return the sorted list of occupied positions (without duplicates)\n        return sorted(list(occupied))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We start by initializing an occupied set with the initial positions.\n- For each step in `moveFrom` and `moveTo`, we check if the current position is in the occupied set; if it is, we remove it from the set and add the new position.\n  - This effectively handles the moving of each marble to the specified positions without duplicating or changing the order of positions.\n- Finally, we convert the occupied set back to a list and sort it. The list comprehension `sorted(list(occupied))` helps us ensure the output is sorted and removes duplicates.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging sets to quickly check for occupancy, and then applying the relocation operations iteratively.

Remove that position and add the new position update.\n\n3. **Final Sorting**: After all moves are completed, sort the set of unique positions to get the final list of occupied positions in sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that each marble's position is properly tracked and the resultant list is sorted with unique positions.

This allows us to insert and remove positions in O(1) amortized time, which is important for our time complexity analysis.\n  \n- **Iterate over moves**: We iterate over the `moveFrom` and `moveTo` arrays using `zip`, which pairs up the elements in each list.\n\n- **Update positions**: If we find a position in `nums` that matches the `src` in the current move, we remove it from the set and add the `dest`.

Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Convert the `nums` array into a set to efficiently perform membership checks.\n\n2. **Process Moves**: For each move, we need to:\n   - Remove the marbles currently at `moveFrom[i]`.\n   - Place the marbles at `moveTo[i]`.\n\n3. **Extract Positions**: After processing all moves, extract the set of unique positions that are occupied.\n\n4. **Sort and Report**: Finally, convert the set to a sorted list and return it.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Convert nums to a set to efficiently handle membership checks.\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Simulate the move process.\n        for from_pos, to_pos in zip(moveFrom, moveTo):\n            # Remove all marbles at the \"from\" position.\n            if from_pos in occupied:\n                occupied.remove(from_pos)\n            # Add the marbles to the \"to\" position.\n            occupied.add(to_pos)\n        \n        # Convert the set to a sorted list.\n        result = sorted(occupied)\n        \n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# result = sol.relocateMarbles([1, 6, 7, 8], [1, 7, 2], [2, 9, 5])\n# print(result)  # Output should be [2, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Set for Occupancy**: We use a set to keep track of positions that have marbles. This allows us to efficiently check if a position is occupied, add and remove marbles efficiently.\n  \n- **Iterate Through Moves**: We iterate over pairs of move-from and move-to positions. For each pair, we remove marbles from the `moveFrom` position and add marbles to the `moveTo` position.\n\n- **Return Result**: After processing all moves, convert the set of occupied positions back to a sorted list. ", "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of moving the marbles through various positions, while maintaining accurate positions after each step. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize a Set of Occupied Positions**: We'll use a set to track the positions that are currently occupied by marbles. This set will initially contain all positions in the `nums` array.\n\n2. **Iterate over the Moves**: For each step (`i`), we'll remove the marbles currently at `moveFrom[i]` and add the marbles to `moveTo[i]`.\n\n3. **Update the Set of Occupied Positions**: Add `moveTo[i]` if it wasn't previously occupied, and remove `moveFrom[i]` if it's no longer occupied.\n\n4. **Sort and Convert to List**: Sort the set of occupied positions, convert it to a list, and return it.\n\nHere's the complete Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize a set of occupied positions\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Iterate over the moves\n        for i in range(len(moveFrom)):\n            # Remove the marble from the old position\n            occupied.discard(moveFrom[i])\n            # Add the marble to the new position\n            occupied.add(moveTo[i])\n        \n        # Sort the list and return it\n        return sorted(occupied)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently tracks the occupied positions after each move and ensures the result is sorted. ", "\nTo complete this problem, we will perform a series of moves on a set of marbles initially located at `nums`. After every move from one position to another, we want to extract all the occupied positions and sort them.\n\nThe approach is to keep track of the positions by maintaining a set of integers. Each move operation involves adding/removing positions from the set based on the `moveFrom` and `moveTo` arrays. After all the operations, we sort the positions to get the sorted result.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        # A set to track occupied positions\n        occupied = set(nums)\n        \n        # Perform all moves\n        for from_pos, to_pos in zip(moveFrom, moveTo):\n            # If the marble is already in the to_pos, it's effectively moved\n            if from_pos == to_pos:\n                continue\n            # Remove the marble from the from_pos\n            if from_pos in occupied:\n                occupied.remove(from_pos)\n            # If the to_pos was previously empty, add the new marble\n            if to_pos not in occupied:\n                occupied.add(to_pos)\n        \n        # Convert the set to a sorted list\n        return sorted(occupied)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization:** \n   - We start by creating a `set` from the initial marbles positions. This will help in efficiently checking the presence of a position at O(1) time.\n   - We iterate over the given moves.\n\n2. **Performing Moves:**\n   - For each move, we verify if the marble at the starting position needs to be moved `from_pos`.\n   - If it needs to be moved, we remove it from the occupied set.\n   - We add the new position `to_pos` if it was previously empty.\n\n3. **Sorting and Returning:**\n   - After processing all the moves, convert the `occupied` set to a sorted list, which will then be returned.\n\nThis ensures that we correctly determine the sorted list of occupied positions after the series of moves. ", "To solve the problem of relocating marbles, we need to simulate the moves specified in `moveFrom` and `moveTo` and determine the sorted list of unique positions where at least one marble is present.

This allows us to efficiently manage the number of marbles at each position.\n  \n- **Moving Marbles**: We iterate over the list of `moveFrom` and `moveTo` pairs and move marbles from one position to another. If the move is valid (i.e., no self-move), we update the counts in `marbles` accordingly.\n\n- **Filter Positions**: After all moves are performed, we collect all positions where at least one marble is present using a list comprehension.\n\n- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of positions and return it. This approach ensures that the positions are in a sorted order, which is the desired output. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate the movements of marbles through a series of position changes. The key here is to maintain a set of unique positions that are occupied after each move.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert the `nums` list to a set `occupied` to quickly determine the initial occupied positions.\n2. Iterate over the `moveFrom` and `moveTo` lists simultaneously.\n3. For each step `i`, update the `occupied` set by removing all marbles at `moveFrom[i]` and adding marbles to `moveTo[i]`.\n4.

This set will allow us to quickly add and remove positions when required.\n- **Iterating through Movements:** We iterate over both the `moveFrom` and `moveTo` lists simultaneously. If a position from `moveFrom` is currently occupied, we remove it from `occupied`. If a position in `moveTo` does not already appear in `occupied`, we add it.\n- **Output Order:** Finally, we return the sorted list of positions from `occupied`. Since set elements are sorted by default, this automatically provides the required output order.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging the set's O(1) insertion, removal, and sorting characteristics, making it suitable for handling a large number of marbles.

We calculate the total contribution of the row or column based on the current query `vali`.\n- By maintaining these sets, we ensure that each row or column can be contributed to the total sum exactly once.\n\nThis approach ensures we calculate the correct sum by taking into account all valid query combinations.

You add the value to `col_sum` only if the column hasn't been set before (i.e., if the number of elements in the column is less than `n`).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Sum**: The total sum of the matrix after applying all queries is calculated as the sum of the `row_sum` and `col_sum`.\n\nLet's implement the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        row_sum = 0\n        col_sum = 0\n        row_count = 0\n        col_count = 0\n\n        for query in queries:\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            if typei == 0:  # Set values in row\n                if row_count < n:\n                    row_sum += vali\n                    row_count += 1\n            else:  # Set values in column\n                if col_count < n:\n                    col_sum += vali\n                    col_count += 1\n\n        return row_sum + col_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `row_sum` tracks the sum of values in all rows that have been set.\n- `col_sum` tracks the sum of values in all columns that have been set.\n- `row_count` keeps track of the number of rows that have been set.\n- `col_count` keeps track of the number of columns that have been set.\n\nThe algorithm iterates through the queries, adding values to `row_sum` and `col_sum` only if a row or column has not been set before. This ensures that each cell is set only once, avoiding multiple addition of identical values.\n\nFinally, the total sum is calculated by summing `row_sum` and `col_sum`, which effectively sums all elements of the matrix. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to update a matrix according to the given queries. Each query can either set the values in a row or a column to a specific value, overwriting existing data. \n\nTo efficiently compute the final sum, we'll use the following approach:\n- Use a boolean mask to keep track of which rows and columns have been initialized (set).\n- As we iterate through the queries, if a row or column has not been set before, we add it to the sum.\n\nLet's implement this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        total_sum = 0\n        # Store whether a row or column has been initialized\n        row_set = [False] * n\n        col_set = [False] * n\n\n        # Apply each query\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:  # Row\n                if not row_set[indexi]:\n                    row_set[indexi] = True\n                    total_sum += vali * (n - sum(col_set))\n            else:  # Column\n                if not col_set[indexi]:\n                    col_set[indexi] = True\n                    total_sum += vali * (n - sum(row_set))\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.matrixSumQueries(3, [[0,0,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]]))  # Example call\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Masks**:\n   - `row_set` is a boolean list of length `n` to keep track of which rows have been set (`False` initially).\n   - `col_set` is a boolean list of length `n` to keep track of which columns have been set (`False` initially).\n\n2. **Iterate through Queries**:\n   - For each query, check the row or column index.\n   - If it hasn't been set before, add its contribution to the total sum.\n\n3. **Contribution Calculation**: \n   - If a row or column is set, only the unset dimensions contribute to the sum.\n   - We compute the sum as `vali * (n - sum(set_dimension))`, where `set_dimension` is the count of dimensions that have been set (either rows or columns).\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the total sum after applying the queries, taking into account the unaccounted cells, ensuring that the sum is correct.

Each query type changes a single row or column at a time.\n\n3. **Calculate Sum**: Sum all the elements in the matrix to get the total sum after all queries have been applied.\n\nLet’s implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # This dictionary will help us keep track of how many times each row or column was updated\n        row_count = {i: 0 for i in range(n)}\n        col_count = {i: 0 for i in range(n)}\n        \n        # Apply queries\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if row_count[indexi] == 0:\n                        matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n                row_count[indexi] += 1\n            else:\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if col_count[indexi] == 0:\n                        matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n                col_count[indexi] += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum after all updates\n        total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in matrix)\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# result = solution.matrixSumQueries(n, queries)\n# print(result)  # Output: Calculated sum of the matrix after all queries are applied\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We create an `n x n` matrix initialized with zeros and dictionaries to keep track of which rows and columns are updated.\n\n- **Applying Queries**:\n  - For each query, if `typei == 0`, we set all elements in the specified row to `vali`.\n  - For each query, if `typei == 1`, we set all elements in the specified column to `vali`.\n\n- **Counting Updates**: We increment the dictionary `row_count` and `col_count` to keep track of how many times each row and column was updated.\n\n- **Sum Calculation**: Finally, we sum all the elements in the matrix to get the total sum. ", "\nThe solution for this problem involves updating the matrix by applying different operations (setting rows or columns to a specific value) based on the `queries` list. The idea is to accumulate the sum of all non-zero elements in the matrix at the end. \n\nHere's how the code can be implemented:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize the matrix with zeros\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        # These sets allow us to track if a row or column has been filled with a value\n        filled_rows = set()\n        filled_cols = set()\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Reverse the order of queries to process them bottom-up\n        # This ensures that we're applying the correct values to rows and columns\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries[::-1]:\n            if typei == 0:\n                if indexi not in filled_rows:\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n                        total_sum += vali\n                    filled_rows.add(indexi)\n            else:\n                if indexi not in filled_cols:\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n                        total_sum += vali\n                    filled_cols.add(indexi)\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization and Data Structures**: We start with a 0-filled matrix, and empty sets for rows and columns that are marked as filled. \n- **Reverse Query Processing**: Since the queries are processed in reverse, we start from the end and work backwards. This ensures that each query affects the result in a particular way, and we end up with a correct final sum.\n- **Adding Values**: For each query, we identify if it is related to a row or column. For a row:\n  - If the row has not been filled with a value, we assign the value to all columns in that row, and update the sum. This creates a uniform row with the value `vali`.\n  - We also add the row index to `filled_rows` to ensure it is not processed again in future queries.\n- **Sum Calculation**: By summing over the matrix after all queries, we can get the final count of all non-zero elements. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate the queries and compute the sum of the resulting matrix. We can do this efficiently by keeping track of the total number of rows and columns affected by each query.\n\nThe following steps outline the approach:\n\n1. Initialize a 2D list `matrix` to store the matrix values. Initialize all values to 0.\n2. Iterate over the queries from last to first.\n3. For each query, update the matrix based on the type (row or column).\n4. Use a set to track which rows and columns have been altered by any query, to avoid double-counting those that are set in multiple queries.\n5. Calculate the sum of the matrix after all queries are applied.\n\nHere's the complete function implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        rows_altered = set()\n        cols_altered = set()\n        \n        # Apply each query in reverse order to avoid double counting\n        for query_type, index, value in reversed(queries):\n            if query_type == 0:\n                if index not in rows_altered:\n                    # In case a row has not been altered before\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        matrix[index][j] = value\n                    rows_altered.add(index)\n            else:\n                if index not in cols_altered:\n                    # In case a column has not been altered before\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        matrix[i][index] = value\n                    cols_altered.add(index)\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of the matrix\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                total_sum += matrix[i][j]\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We start by creating a matrix of zeros with dimensions `n x n`.\n- Then we iterate backwards over the queries. This is done to avoid double counting if the same query type and index is given multiple times.\n- We use sets (`rows_altered` and `cols_altered`) to ensure that we only alter a given row or column once.\n- Finally, we compute the sum of all elements in the matrix to get the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sum is computed efficiently with minimal additional operations. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maintain a 0-indexed n x n matrix, where each cell has an initial value of 0. For each query, we need to apply updates to rows or columns depending on the type `typei`, so that the cell at position `(rowi, coli)` has the value `vali`. \n\nTo achieve this, we'll use a couple of data structures:\n- An array `rows` to track updates to rows.\n- An array `cols` to track updates to columns.\n\nThe `rows` and `cols` arrays contain either `vali` or 0. If a row or column is updated with `vali`, the value stored at that row or column will be overridden. Otherwise, the value is still 0.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize the matrix with zeros\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        # Arrays to track updates to rows and columns\n        rows = [0] * n\n        cols = [0] * n\n        \n        # Iterate through the queries\n        for query in queries:\n            # Unpack the query\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            # If this is a row query\n            if typei == 0:\n                # If this row has not been updated with any other value, update it\n                if rows[indexi] == 0:\n                    # Update the row's value\n                    rows[indexi] = vali\n                    # Update the matrix's value\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n            \n            # If this is a column query\n            elif typei == 1:\n                # If this column has not been updated with any other value, update it\n                if cols[indexi] == 0:\n                    # Update the column's value\n                    cols[indexi] = vali\n                    # Update the matrix's value\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of non-zero values in the matrix\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                total_sum += matrix[i][j]\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- Initialization: We initialize the matrix with `0`s, and two arrays `rows` and `cols` to keep track of updates to rows and columns, respectively.\n- Processing Query:\n  - For each query, we check the query type, `typei`.\n  - If `typei = 0`, we update the row with index `indexi` with value `vali`.\n  - If `typei = 1`, we update the column with index `indexi` with value `vali`.\n  - To perform this operation, we loop through the matrix to modify values if the corresponding row or column has not been updated before.\n- Result Calculation: After all queries are processed, we compute the sum of all non-zero values in the matrix.\n\nThis approach ensures that each row or column is updated only once, which efficiently handles the problem. ", "\nLet's break down the solution for the problem of applying queries on a matrix and calculating the sum. We need to update the rows and columns as specified by the queries. The cells in the matrix can either be set to a particular value or filled with zeroes.\n\nThe key observation is that when we set a row or column, any existing values will be overwritten.

This ensures any subsequent operations are effectively before other operations.\n- **Sum Calculation**: \n  - For each query, if it changes a row, we calculate how many columns had not been set, and multiply those by the query value.\n  - If it changes a column, do the same calculation for rows.\n- **Overwriting**: \n  - If a row or column has already been changed, the calculations are reduced to the number of rows or columns that have not been changed.\n- **Simplification**: \n  - We use the difference between the number of cells in the row/column and the cells we have changed to compute the sum.

This means, all elements in the column `coli` are set to `vali`.\n\n3. **Overlapping Updates**: When updating either a row or a column, updates to an element are additive, so if more than one value is set for a single element, the sum of all values is used.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Finally, after all the queries are processed, we sum all the elements in the matrix to find the total.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a matrix of zeros\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Track which rows and columns are set for each type\n        row_set = set()\n        col_set = set()\n        \n        # Apply each query\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:  # Set entire row\n                if indexi not in row_set:\n                    for j in range(n):\n                        matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n                    row_set.add(indexi)\n            else:  # Set entire column\n                if indexi not in col_set:\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n                    col_set.add(indexi)\n        \n        # Calculate the sum\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                total_sum += matrix[i][j]\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.matrixSumQueries(n, queries))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Matrix Initialization**: We use an initial matrix filled with zeros to begin with.\n  \n- **Sets for Rows and Columns**: We use two sets to keep track of which rows and columns are set.\n\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we ensure we are not overwriting existing values (by checking if the indices are already involved in set operations).\n\n- **Sum Calculation**: Finally, sum all elements in the resulting matrix to compute the total.

This ensures that if an element needs to be re-written, it will be overwritten by the last query applied.\n   - For each query, we check if the row or column has already been filled. If it has, we skip it to prevent unwanted changes.\n\n3. **Updating the Matrix**:\n   - For each query of type 0 (modifying a row), we update all elements in the specified row with the provided value.\n   - For each query of type 1 (modifying a column), we update all elements in the specified column with the provided value.\n\n4. **Summing the Matrix**:\n   - After processing all queries, add up the total sum of the matrix, which is the sum of all elements after all modifications have been completed.\n\nThis solution efficiently applies the given queries in their prespecified order to update the matrix and compute its sum. ", "\nThe goal is to simulate the application of the given queries to a matrix to calculate the sum of its elements. Each query can affect either the rows or columns of the matrix, and each matrix position can be set to a specific value.\n\nAfter applying the queries, you must calculate the sum of all the elements.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialization**:  \n   We start by initializing an `n x n` matrix filled with 0's.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Queries**:  \n   For each query, we update either the rows or columns based on the `typei` parameter.\n\n3. **Calculate Sum**:  \n   After updating the matrix, calculate the sum of all elements by simply iterating through the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize matrix with zeros\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Keep track of the total number of rows and columns to be updated\n        total_rows = n\n        total_cols = n\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:  # Row update\n                matrix[indexi] = [vali] * n\n                total_rows -= 1\n            \n            elif typei == 1:  # Column update\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if matrix[j][indexi] == 0:\n                        matrix[j][indexi] = vali\n                        total_cols -= 1\n        \n        # Calculate sum of all elements\n        sum_result = 0\n        for row in matrix:\n            sum_result += sum(row)\n        \n        return sum_result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization**:\n  - We start with an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.\n  - `total_rows` and `total_cols` variables keep track of how many rows and columns have not been completely updated yet.\n\n- **Iterate through the Queries**:\n  - For each query:\n    - If `typei` is 0, it means we need to update the row indicated by `indexi`, so we set all elements in that row to `vali`.\n    - If `typei` is 1, it means we need to update the column indicated by `indexi`, so we set all non-zero elements in this column to `vali`.\n\n- **Calculate Sum**:\n  - After processing all queries, calculate the sum by iterating over the matrix and summing all elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the matrix updates and sum calculation using the provided operations, resulting in the correct answer. ", "To solve the problem of updating a matrix and computing the sum of its elements based on the given queries, we can follow an approach using a simple array to track the values in each row and column. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        row_values = [0] * n  # Initialize an array to track row values\n        col_values = [0] * n  # Initialize an array to track column values\n        \n        # Process each query in reverse order\n        # This ensures we process the most recent queries first\n        for query in reversed(queries):\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            if typei == 0:\n                # Update row values\n                row_values[indexi] = vali\n            else:\n                # Update column values\n                col_values[indexi] = vali\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            # Calculate the sum of the values in each row\n            row_sum = max(0, row_values[i])\n            # Calculate the sum of the values in each column\n            col_sum = max(0, col_values[i])\n            # Add the maximum of zero and the sum of row and col\n            total_sum += max(0, row_sum + col_sum)\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two arrays `row_values` and `col_values` with zeros, one for each dimension. \n\n2. **Reverse Loop**: Iterate through the queries in reverse order. This is because we need the most recent queries to have the highest impact. This ensures that existing values are overwritten correctly. \n\n3. **Action Decision**: For each query, if it is a row query (type 0), set the element at `row_values[indexi]` to `vali`. If it is a column query (type 1), set the element at `col_values[indexi]` to `vali`.\n\n4. **Calculate Sum**: For each row, calculate the maximum of zero (if no value was set for that row) and the sum of the values in that row. Similarly, for each column, calculate the sum of the maximum of zero (if no value was set for that column) and the sum of the values in that column.\n\n5. **Result**: Calculate the sum of the matrix by adding the maximum of the sums from each row and column cell.\n\nThis approach ensures correct handling of the most recent values, resulting in an efficient solution when updating the matrix with many queries. ", "\nWe'll implement a solution to calculate the sum after applying the specified queries to a matrix. The approach involves keeping track of the rows and columns that are set by each query. We'll iterate through the queries and update our sum accordingly.\n\n1. **Initialize a Set for Rows and Columns:** We'll use sets to track which rows and columns are already set to avoid duplicates.\n\n2. **Iterate through Queries:** For each query, check if the row or column associated with the query has already been marked as set. If so, skip the current query, otherwise update the sum and mark the row or column as set.\n\n3. **Update the Sum:** If a query sets a row or column, it will affect the final sum. For each query, increment the sum by either changing the number of set rows or columns.\n\nThis approach ensures we only update the matrix once for each unique query. \n\nBelow is the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Set to keep track of rows and columns that have been set\n        rows_set = set()\n        cols_set = set()\n        \n        # Total sum of matrix elements\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the queries\n        for query in queries:\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            # If the query affects rows\n            if typei == 0:\n                # If row is already set, skip this query\n                if indexi in rows_set:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Update the sum by negating the old number of rows affected,\n                # and adding new ones\n                total_sum -= len(rows_set) * n  # Remove previous sum\n                total_sum += (n - len(rows_set)) * vali\n                \n                # Mark the row as set\n                rows_set.add(indexi)\n            \n            # If the query affects columns\n            elif typei == 1:\n                # If column is already set, skip this query\n                if indexi in cols_set:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Update the sum by negating the old number of columns affected,\n                # and adding new ones\n                total_sum -= len(cols_set) * n  # Remove previous sum\n                total_sum += (n - len(cols_set)) * vali\n                \n                # Mark the column as set\n                cols_set.add(indexi)\n\n        return total_sum\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **rows_set and cols_set:** These sets keep track of the rows and columns that have been set.\n- **total_sum:** Keeps track of the sum of all elements in the matrix after applying all queries.\n- **Query Processing:** For each query:\n  - If the query affects rows, check if the row has already been set. If not, add the effective number of rows to the sum.\n  - If the query affects columns, check if the column has already been set. If not, add the effective number of columns to the sum.\n  - The effective number of affected rows/columns is calculated based on how many rows/columns have been set so far.\n- **Time Complexity:** The solution processes each query exactly once, which is O(n * m) where n is the number of rows/columns and m is the number of queries. The operation used to determine effective number of affected rows/columns is constant, so the overall complexity is linear in the number of queries.\n\nThis code efficiently updates the matrix by not repeating updates for already set rows and columns, ensuring good performance. ", "\nTo solve the problem of applying row or column queries to a matrix, we can utilize a mathematical approach. The key idea is to only count each element once, regardless of whether it is covered by multiple queries. \n\nThe idea is to simulate the queries sequentially. For each query type, we mark all affected rows/columns as having a fixed value, since they will not be affected by any future queries. \n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        rows_filled = 0\n        cols_filled = 0\n        total_sum = 0\n        rows_seen = set()\n        cols_seen = set()\n        \n        # Iterate backwards through the queries\n        for query in reversed(queries):\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            if typei == 0:\n                if indexi not in rows_seen:\n                    rows_seen.add(indexi)\n                    rows_filled += 1\n                    total_sum += vali * (n - cols_filled)\n            \n            elif typei == 1:\n                if indexi not in cols_seen:\n                    cols_seen.add(indexi)\n                    cols_filled += 1\n                    total_sum += vali * (n - rows_filled)\n            \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.matrixSumQueries(3, [[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]]))  # Output should be 6\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize three counters: `rows_filled`, `cols_filled`, and `total_sum`.\n   - We use sets `rows_seen` and `cols_seen` to track the indices of rows and columns that are already marked.\n\n2. **Reverse Iteration**:\n   - We iterate over the queries in reverse order because each query affects future calculations.\n\n3. **Type and Index Handling**:\n   - For each query, we check whether the index is already marked.\n   - If it's not marked, we mark it and update the sum accordingly. This is because future queries will not affect these elements.\n\n4. **Calculation of Sum**:\n   - For a query to a row, we calculate the sum of all elements in the row that are not marked by columns. For each row that is not marked, we multiply the sum by `n - cols_filled` to account for the remaining columns that have not been marked yet.\n   - Similarly, for a query to a column, we calculate the sum of all elements in the column that are not marked by rows. For each column that is not marked, we multiply the sum by `n - rows_filled` to account for the remaining rows that have not been marked yet.\n\n5. **Final Sum Calculation**:\n   - The total sum is accumulated as each query is processed. This ensures that we only count each element once and calculate the sum for the entire matrix after all queries have been applied.\n\nThis solution ensures that the matrix is consistently updated and the sum of its elements is accurately calculated by only considering the elements that have been impacted by the queries. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to update a matrix based on the provided queries and calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this:\n\n1. **Initalize the Matrix**: Start with an n x n matrix filled with 0's.\n2. **Process the Queries**:\n   - For each query with `typei` set to `0`, update all elements in the row with index `indexi` to be `vali`.\n   - For each query with `typei` set to `1`, update all elements in the column with index `indexi` to be `vali`.\n3. **Calculate the Sum**: After all queries are processed, sum all the elements in the matrix.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize the matrix with 0's\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Process all queries\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:\n                # Update all elements in the row with index indexi\n                for j in range(n):\n                    matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n            else:\n                # Update all elements in the column with index indexi\n                for i in range(n):\n                    matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                total_sum += matrix[i][j]\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize the matrix to be a list of lists, where each row is a list of `n` zeros.\n- **Processing Queries**:\n  - For each query, if `typei` is `0`, update all elements in the row `indexi` by assigning them the value `vali`.\n  - If `typei` is `1`, update all elements in the column `indexi` by assigning them the value `vali`.\n- **Calculating the Sum**: After all the queries are processed, the matrix is complete, and the sum is calculated by summing all elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently updates the matrix based on the provided queries and calculates the sum, requiring only a few iterations through the matrix. ", "To solve this problem, we can keep track of the total effect of each row and column, separately. Each row/column can either be fully overwritten by a single query, or partially updated by multiple queries of the same type.\n\nThe total sum of numbers in the matrix is determined by the sum of the partially updated (or fully overwritten) rows and columns. Let's implement this using a dictionary to track unique row/column indices and their values.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Dictionary to track the values for each unique row/column index\n        row_values = {}\n        col_values = {}\n        \n        for query in queries:\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            # If the query is for a row\n            if typei == 0:\n                # Add or update the value for this row\n                row_values[indexi] = vali\n            \n            # If the query is for a column\n            else:\n                # Add or update the value for this column\n                col_values[indexi] = vali\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of numbers in the matrix\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # For each row\n        for row in range(n):\n            # Find the maximum value for this row that has been overwritten\n            max_val = 0\n            \n            # Check the row_values dictionary\n            if row in row_values:\n                max_val = row_values[row]\n            \n            # Calculate the sum for this row\n            for col in range(n):\n                # Check the col_values dictionary\n                col_val = col_values.get(col, 0)\n                total_sum += max(max_val, col_val)\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example Usage:\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.matrixSumQueries(4, [[0, 0, 4], [0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [0, 3, 1], [1, 2, 4]]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Dictionary Usage**: We use two dictionaries, `row_values` and `col_values`, to track the value affecting each row and column, respectively.\n- **Iterate Over Each Query**: For each query:\n  - If typei == 0, update the value for the row `indexi` in `row_values`.\n  - If typei == 1, update the value for the column `indexi` in `col_values`.\n- **Compute Total Sum**: For each row, calculate the maximum overwritten value. If the row has not been overwritten, its maximum value defaults to 0. Then, for each column, calculate the total sum for that row that depends on the maximum row value and the value in the column from `col_values`.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient handling of any overlaps and arithmetic calculations, thereby providing the final sum accurately.

As we iterate through the queries, we'll track which rows and columns are already set, and update these appropriately.

If a row or column is already marked as updated, we ignore its value.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        row_updated = set()\n        col_updated = set()\n\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        # Apply each query\n        for query in queries:\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            # If typei == 0, set the values in the row\n            if typei == 0:\n                if indexi not in row_updated:\n                    row_updated.add(indexi)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(col_updated)) * vali\n            \n            # If typei == 1, set the values in the column\n            if typei == 1:\n                if indexi not in col_updated:\n                    col_updated.add(indexi)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(row_updated)) * vali\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sets**: `row_updated` and `col_updated` are used to keep track of the indices for rows and columns that have been set.\n- **Sum Calculation**: For each query, if an index has not been updated yet, the contribution to total sum can be calculated as `(n - len(col_updated or row_updated)) * vali`. This accounts for all cells in the specified row or column that have not yet been set to a non-zero value.\n- **Return**: The `total_sum` is returned as the result after processing all queries.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the sum by leveraging sets to ensure each row or column is processed at most once. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate the modifications to the matrix based on the given queries and compute the sum of all values in the resulting matrix. The `matrixSumQueries` function should return the sum of values after all queries have been applied.\n\nThe approach involves maintaining two sets to keep track of which rows and columns are assigned a value using the queries. The sum that needs to be calculated includes all values in the matrix except those from rows and columns that have been set to a value.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Two sets to track which rows and columns are set\n        row_filled = set()\n        col_filled = set()\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each query in reverse order\n        for query in reversed(queries):\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            # If the row/column is not already filled\n            if typei == 0 and indexi not in row_filled:\n                row_filled.add(indexi)\n                # Calculate the total impact of the current row addition\n                total_sum += vali * (n - len(col_filled))\n            elif typei == 1 and indexi not in col_filled:\n                col_filled.add(indexi)\n                # Calculate the total impact of the current column addition\n                total_sum += vali * (n - len(row_filled))\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We use sets to keep track of which rows and columns have been assigned values.\n- We process queries in reverse order. This is because setting a particular row or column only affects unmodified values. Changes made in a later query do not affect previous ones.\n- For each query:\n  - If setting a row, ensure the row hasn't been previously set, then add the number of columns that haven't been set to the result.\n  - If setting a column, ensure the column hasn't been previously set, then add the number of rows that haven't been set to the result.\n- The total sum is calculated by summing valid matrix elements (each minus the number of rows or columns that have been set).\n\nThis approach ensures the calculation is done in a single pass over the queries, making it efficient. ", "\nTo solve the problem of applying the queries on a matrix and calculating the sum, we can utilize two arrays, one for rows and another for columns. For each query, update the corresponding row or column with `vali`, and calculate the total sum of the matrix after all queries.\n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize two arrays to record the values for rows and columns\n        row_values = [0] * n\n        col_values = [0] * n\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Reverse the sequence of queries to process the last queries first\n        queries.reverse()\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            # Update the row or column based on the query type\n            if typei == 0:\n                # If the row is already updated, skip it.\n                if row_values[indexi] != 0:\n                    continue\n                row_values[indexi] = vali\n            else:\n                # If the column is already updated, skip it.\n                if col_values[indexi] != 0:\n                    continue\n                col_values[indexi] = vali\n            \n            # Calculate the current total by summing up the rows and columns\n            total_sum += sum(row_values) * (n - sum(col_values))\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize two arrays `row_values` and `col_values` to keep track of the values for each row and column. Both are initialized to 0.\n   - `total_sum` is initialized to zero to compute the sum of the matrix.\n\n2. **Processing Queries**:\n   - We process the queries in reverse order because the most recent changes should have the highest impact.\n   - For each query, we check if the matrix (the row or column) has already been updated.\n   - If it hasn't been updated, update it with `vali`.\n   - Compute the new total sum after updating the matrix.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Sum**:\n   - For each query, we calculate the sum of rows and columns separately.\n   - Multiply the sum of rows by the sum of unset columns, ensuring that each cell is covered once.\n\nThis approach ensures that the most recent changes are processed first, helping to correctly aggregate the matrix sum. ", "\nHere's the completed Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        rows = set()\n        cols = set()\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        for type_, index, value in reversed(queries):\n            if type_ == 0:\n                if index not in rows:\n                    rows.add(index)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(cols)) * value\n            else:\n                if index not in cols:\n                    cols.add(index)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(rows)) * value\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.matrixSumQueries(3, [[0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 2], [0, 2, 3], [1, 0, 4]]))  # Output should be 23\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Data Structures and Variables**:\n  - `rows`: A set to keep track of the rows we've set to a value.\n  - `cols`: A set to keep track of the columns we've set to a value.\n  - `total_sum`: The sum of all the values in the matrix.\n\n- **Iterate Through Queries**:\n  - Reversed Iteration: Since we want to apply the latest (most recent) queries first, we iterate over queries in a reverse order.\n  - Calculate Row and Column Changes: If the `type` is 0, set values in the row; if the `type` is 1, set values in the column.\n  - If a row or column is set, add the change in values to `total_sum`.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of values in the matrix after applying all the queries, using sets for tracking rows and columns, and reversing the queries to process them from last to first. ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations from the queries to a matrix. However, the matrix is initially filled with zeros, and we must consider the following:\n\n1. **Row Changes**: For a row operation (`typei == 0`), we set every element in that row to `vali`.\n2. **Column Changes**: For a column operation (`typei == 1`), we set every element in that column to `vali`.\n\nWe'll use a set to keep track of the rows and columns that have been updated. This will allow us to only calculate the sum of elements in the matrix once all changes have been applied.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        rows_updated = set()\n        cols_updated = set()\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # Process each query in reverse order\n        for typei, indexi, vali in reversed(queries):\n            # If the type is 0, it's a row operation\n            if typei == 0:\n                if indexi not in rows_updated:\n                    # Set the entire row to vali\n                    total_sum += (vali * n)\n                    rows_updated.add(indexi)\n            \n            # If the type is 1, it's a column operation\n            elif typei == 1:\n                if indexi not in cols_updated:\n                    # Set the entire column to vali\n                    total_sum += (vali * n)\n                    cols_updated.add(indexi)\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.matrixSumQueries(3, [[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,4]]))  # Output should be 27\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We iterate through the queries in reverse order. This ensures that we are processing the latest changes first, which is crucial to avoid double counting.\n- For each operation, we determine whether the specified row or column has been updated. If it hasn't, we compute the sum of the entire row or column and update the total sum accordingly.\n- We use sets to keep track of which rows and columns have been processed to minimize the total sum calculation.\n- The overall complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of queries and m is the number of changes made. ", "\nTo achieve the objective of updating and summing matrix after applying each query, we can utilize a two-dimensional array (`matrix`). The key idea is to evaluate each query, accounting for the changes as dictated by specific rows or columns. Once completed, sum the resulting `matrix` to find the total sum. \n\nHere is the complete implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize a matrix of zeros\n        \n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            if typei == 0:\n                for j in range(n):\n                    matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n            else:\n                for i in range(n):\n                    matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        for row in matrix:\n            total_sum += sum(row)\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We start with an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Queries**:\n   - For each query:\n     - If `typei == 0`, we set all cells in row `indexi` to `vali`.\n     - If `typei == 1`, we set all cells in column `indexi` to `vali`.\n\n3. **Sum of Matrix**:\n   - Finally, calculate the sum of all integers in the matrix, resulting from the applied changes.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles each query and calculates the final sum, giving you the result you desire.

If it's a type 1 (set column), we iterate over each row and replace ки  the value at `indexi` column ки  with `vali`.\n\n- **Sum Calculation**: Use ки  a double loop to calculate the sum of all elements in the matrix.\n\nThis approach carefully ки  follows the logic ки  described and ensures that the matrix is correctly modified according to the given queries.  ки ", "\nTo solve the problem of calculating the sum after ки  applying the given queries to a matrix, we need to first ки  simulate ки  the effect ки  of each query on the matrix.

We iterate over the `queries` in reverse order.\n  - If `type_i == 0`, we set values in the row specified by `index_i` to `val_i`.\n    - If the row has already been modified (i.e., `index_i` is in `row_values`), we skip this query.\n    - We update `row_sum` by adding `(n - len(col_values)) * val_i`, since `val_i` will replace all values in this row.\n  - If `type_i == 1`, we set values in the column specified by `index_i` to `val_i`.\n    - If the column has already been modified (i.e., `index_i` is in `col_values`), we skip this query.\n    - We update `col_sum` by adding `(n - len(row_values)) * val_i`, since `val_i` will replace all values in this column.\n\n- **Final Result**:\n  - The total sum is calculated as the sum of `row_sum` and `col_sum`.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently calculates the sum of all values in the matrix after all queries are processed, taking into account whether ки  each row or column is already altered ки .  ки ", "\nHere's a step-by-step explanation and the complete Python code for the given ки  problem:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an empty `n x n` matrix `matrix` filled with zeros.\n\n2. **Processing Queries**:\n   - For each query, check the type (`typei`):\n     - If `typei == 0`, set all values in the row `indexi` to `vali`.\n     - If `typei == 1`, set all values in the column `indexi` to `vali`.\n\n3. **Im ки plementation**:\n   -

Ch ки anges made in a later query do not affect previous ones.\n- For each query:\n  - If setting ки  a row, ensure the row hasn't been previously ки  set, then add the number ки  of columns that haven't been set to the result ки .\n  - If setting a column, ensure the column hasn't been previously set, then add the number of rows that haven't been set to the result.\n- The total sum is calculated by summing valid ки  matrix elements (each ки  minus ки  the number of rows or columns that have been set).\n\nThis approach ensures the calculation is done in a single pass over the queries, making it efficient.  ки ", "\nTo solve the problem of applying the queries on a matrix and calculating the sum, we can utilize two arrays, one for rows and another for columns. For each query, update the corresponding row or column with ` ки vali`, and calculate the total sum of the matrix after all queries.\n\nHere is the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize two arrays to record ки  the values for rows and columns\n        row_values = [0] * n\n        col_values = [0] * n\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        # R ки everse the sequence ки  of queries to process the last queries first\n        queries.reverse()\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for typei, indexi, vali in queries:\n            # Update the row or column based on the query type\n            if typei == 0:\n                # If the row is already updated, skip it. ки \n                if row_values[indexi] != 0:\n                    continue\n                row_values[indexi] = vali\n            else:\n                # If the column is already updated, skip it.\n                if col_values[indexi] != 0:\n                    continue\n                col_values[indexi] = vali\n            \n            # Calculate the current total by ки  summing up the rows and columns\n            total_sum += sum(row_values) * (n - sum(col_values))\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize two arrays `row_values` and `col_values` to keep track of the values for each row and column. Both are initialized to 0.\n   - `total_sum` is initialized to zero to compute the sum of the matrix.\n\n2. **Processing Queries**:\n   - We process the queries in reverse order because the most recent changes ки  should have the highest impact.\n   - For each query, we check if the matrix ки  ( ки the ки  row or column) has already been updated.\n   - If it hasn't been updated, update it with `vali`.\n   - Compute the new total sum after updating the matrix.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Sum**:\n   - For each query, we calculate the sum of rows and columns separately.\n   - Mult ки iply the sum of rows by the sum of unset columns, ensuring ки  that each cell is covered once.\n\nThis approach ensures that the most recent changes are processed first, helping ки  to correctly ки  aggregate ки  the matrix sum.  ки ", "\nHere's the completed Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        rows = set()\n        cols = set()\n        total_sum = 0\n        \n        for type_, ки  index, value in reversed(queries):\n            if type_ == 0:\n                if index not in rows:\n                    rows.add(index)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(cols)) * value\n            else:\n                if index not in cols:\n                    cols.add(index)\n                    total_sum += (n - len(rows)) * value\n        \n        return total_sum\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.matrixSumQueries(3, [[0, 0, 1], [1, 2, 2], [0, 2, 3], [1, 0, 4]]))  # Output should be 23\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Data Structures and ки  Variables**:\n  - `rows`: A set to keep track of the rows we ки 've set to a value.\n  - `cols`: A set to keep track of the columns we've set to a value.\n  - `total_sum`: The sum of all the values in the matrix.\n\n- **Iterate Through Queries**:\n  - Re ки versed Iteration: Since we want to apply the latest ( ки most recent) queries first, we iterate over queries ки  in a reverse order.\n  - Calcul ки ate Row ки  and Column Changes: If ки  the ` ки type` is 0, set ки  values in the row; if the `type` is 1, set values in the column.\n  - If ки  a row or column is set, add ки  the change ки  in values to `total_sum`.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of values in the matrix after applying all the queries, using sets for tracking rows and columns, and revers ки ing the queries to process them from last to first.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the given operations from ки  the queries to a matrix.

This ensures that we are processing the latest changes first, which is crucial to avoid double counting.\n- For each operation, we determine ки  whether the specified row or column has been updated. If it hasn't, we compute ки  the sum of the entire row or column and update the total sum accordingly.\n- We use sets to keep track of which rows and columns have been processed ки  to minimize ки  the total ки  sum calculation.\n- The overall complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of queries and m is the number of changes ки  made.  ки ", "\nTo achieve ки  the objective ки  of updating and summing matrix ки  after ки  applying each query, we can utilize a two-dimensional array (`matrix`).

If `type_i` is 0, it means it's a row operation, so add `val_i` to the total sum for each cell in the row `index_i`.\n  - If `type_i` is 1, it's a column operation, so add `val_i` to the total sum for each cell in the column `index_i`.\n  -

Then, sum up the matrix after applying all queries.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Process ки  Queries:** Use ки  a set to track which rows and columns need to be updated as ки  well ки  as the values associated ки  with them. ` ки row_values` and `col_values` are dictionaries used ки  to store the sums ки  of elements ки  that have been modified.\n\n2. **Apply Queries:** Iterate through each query, updating the rows ки  or columns as per ки  the query.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Sum:** Calculate the sum of the matrix by summing the values in `row_values` and `col_values`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        row_values = {}\n        col_values = {}\n        \n        for type, index, value in queries:\n            if type == 0:  # update rows\n                if index not in row_values:\n                    row_values[index] = value * n  # initialize to all 0's\n                else:\n                    row_values[index] = value * n  # set the row to all 'value'\n            else:  # update columns\n                if index not in col_values:\n                    col_values[index] = value * n  # initialize to all 0's\n                else:\n                    col_values[index] = value * n  # set the column to all 'value'\n        \n        # Calculate total sum by summing up rows and columns\n        total_sum = 0\n        for row in row_values.values():\n            total_sum += row\n        for col in col_values.values():\n            total_sum += col\n        \n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Row/Column Tracking:** We maintain two dictionaries, `row_values` and `col_values`, to track the sums of each row and column. Init ки ially, each is set to `n` times the number ки  of cells ки  in the matrix, which is the default value for rows and columns when ки  not overwritten by any query.\n\n- **Updating Rows/Columns:** For each query, if the query type is 0 (i ки .e., setting ки  a row), update `row_values[index]` to `value * n`, which represents all cells in the row being set to that ки  value. Similarly, if the query type is 1 (i.e., setting a column), update `col_values[index]`.\n\n- **Calculating Sum:** Finally, calculate the total sum by summing up the sums in `row_values`, ки  and the sums in `col_values`.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand ки  how each query affects the matrix and subsequently ки  sum the values it ки  contains.

If it's a column, we replace all values in the column with `vali`.\n- **Sum Calculation**: We sum up the elements of the matrix after all operations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we simultaneously ки  update the matrix as ки  per the queries and compute the sum without ки  any interference.  ки ", "\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate the effect ки  of each query on a zero-filled `n x n` matrix and compute the sum of all integers.\n\n1. **Row-Based Updates**: For each query where type ки i == 0, we will set all elements in the row with indexi to vali, overwriting any existing values.\n\n2. **Column-Based Updates**: For each query where typei == 1, we will set all elements in the column with indexi to vali, overwriting any existing values.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Sum**: After processing all queries, we need to sum the values in the matrix.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def matrixSumQueries(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a zero-filled n x n matrix\n        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Use ки  a set to track the rows and columns that have already been updated\n        rows_done ки  = set()\n        cols_done = set()\n        \n        for ки  query in queries:\n            typei, indexi, vali = query\n            \n            if typei == 0:\n                # Update the row by ки  setting all to ки  vali\n                # ки  Skip if the row has already been updated\n                if indexi in rows_done:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(n):\n                    matrix[indexi][j] = vali\n                rows_done.add(indexi)\n                \n            else:\n                # Update the column by setting all to vali\n                # Skip if the column has already been updated\n                if indexi in cols_done:\n                    continue\n                for i in range(n):\n                    matrix[i][indexi] = vali\n                cols_done.add(indexi)\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of all values in the matrix\n        total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in matrix)\n        return total_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We maintain two sets (`rows_done` and `cols_done`) to keep track of which rows and columns have already been fully ки  updated.\n- For each query, we check if we ки 've already updated the row or column. If we have, we skip the update for ки  that index.\n- After applying ки  all updates, we calculate the sum of all values in the matrix.  ки ", "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of setting specific ки  rows or columns to specific values in a matrix and calculate the sum of values ки  in the resulting matrix.

{"idx": 5, "pred": ["\nTo solve the problem of finding the sum of the squares of special elements in the array `nums`, we need to iterate through every element in the list and check if its index `i` divides the length of the list `n`. Special elements are defined as those that satisfy the condition `n % i == 0`. We'll compute the sum of squares of all such elements.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        result = 0\n\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            if n % (i + 1) == 0:\n                # i+1 because enumerate() returns 0-indexed indices\n                result += num ** 2\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.sumOfSquares([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Example call to the method\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate over each element in the list and its index `i` using the `enumerate()` function.\n\n2. **Check for Special Elements**: We check if the current index `i` is a special element by checking `n % (i + 1) == 0`. This is because the condition `n % i == 0` can be rewritten as `(i + 1) % (n % (i + 1)) == 0`, which is equivalent.

If `num` is a factor of `n`, that is, if `n % num == 0`, that means `n` is divisible by `num`, so `num` is a special number.\n\n3. **Square and Sum**: Sum the squares of each special number.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the calculated `total`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the sum of squares of special numbers by iterating through the input and only considering the factors of `n`.

"], "task_id": "sum-of-squares-of-special-elements", "question": "You are given a 1-indexed integer array nums of length n.\nAn element nums[i] of nums is called special if i divides n, i.e. n % i == 0.\nReturn the sum of the squares of all special elements of nums.\n \nPlease complete the following python code precisely:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n```", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find all the special elements in the given list `nums` and return the sum of their squares. An element `nums[i]` is special if the index `i` (1-based index) divides `n` (length of the list `nums`). This means that `n % i == 0`.\n\nWe'll iterate through the list `nums` and check for each index (converted to 1-based) whether it divides `n`. If it does, we'll square the element at that index and add it to our sum. Finally, we'll return the total sum.\n\nHere's the complete Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        sum_squares = 0\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                sum_squares += nums[i - 1] ** 2\n        return sum_squares\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Importing List**: We import `List` from `typing` to specify that the input `nums` is a list of integers.\n\n2. **Calculate Length**: We first store the length of `nums` in `n`.\n\n3. **Initialize Sum**: We initialize `sum_squares` to `0`. This variable will track the sum of the squares of special elements.\n\n4. **Loop Through Indexes**: We use a loop to iterate through each index from `1` to `n` (inclusive). This helps us use a 1-based index directly in our calculations.\n\n5. **Check Special Condition**: Inside the loop, we check if `n % i` is `0`. If true, it means that `i` divides `n`, and the element at the `i-1` index in the 0-based `nums` array is special.\n\n6. **Calculate Square and Sum**: If an element is special, we add its square (`nums[i - 1] ** 2`) to `sum_squares`.\n\n7. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, `sum_squares` contains the desired sum of squares of all special elements, which we then return.", "response_number": 0, "code_list": ["from typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        result = 0\n\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            if n % (i + 1) == 0:\n                # i+1 because enumerate() returns 0-indexed indices\n                result += num ** 2\n\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.sumOfSquares([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Example call to the method", "from typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                # If i divides n, nums[i -
